Yakima especially those of what was formerly the ruling class feel the same dislike and suspicion of the white man that moved their fathers in the uprising of 1855 to attempt to expel the newcomers from their territory The brooding expression of dissatisfaction on the face of this man seemingly represents inherent tribal antipathy to the white race engendered by their aggression and greed 221 Wife of Mnainak Yakima Mnainak son of the former chief of the Columbia River village Skin at the north side of Celilo falls is probably the man of greatest influence among the remnant of the cognate bands that constitute the Yakima 222 Wishnai Yakima 223 Camp of the Yakima 224 Mountain camp Yakima The reservation of the Yakima rises from the level of the valley of the Yakima river to the lower range of mountains between that stream and the Columbia In the glades of the mountains small parties pitch their tipis in the spring time and the women and girls gather edible roots notably bitterroot 225 Klickitat type 226 Klickitat profile 227 Flathead type Probably the Indian does not live in whose veins does not flow the blood of more than one tribe The Flatheads are unusually composite and the original of the portrait here presented while as good a type as can be found no doubt is of a very different mould from that of a Flathead of three or four generations ago 228 Flathead profile 229 Flathead chief Through the medium of their annual incursions into the buffalo plains east of the Rocky mountains the Flatheads adopted much of the plains culture Not only their domicile the tipi their garments weapons and articles of adornment came from this source but many of their dances were in imitation of similar ceremonies practised by the prairie tribes Prominent features of the accoutrement of this Flathead chief are his war club of the plains type and an eagle bone whistle such as was used in the Sun Dance The Flatheads however never acquired the sun rite 230 Big Knife Flathead Big Knife s ancestry includes an Iroquois perhaps a halfbreed one of a number who came into the Northwest as employes of the Hudson s Bay Company The head dress of buffalo horns and scalp is not characteristic of the Salish tribes but of the plains Indians 231 Flathead camp 232 Flathead camp on Jocko River The scene depicts a small camp among the pines on the reservation of the Flatheads in western Montana the majestic Rocky mountains rising abruptly in the background 233 Stormy day Flathead The day was a succession of sudden squalls descending from the near by mountains Just a moment before sunset when all hope of accomplishing anything with a camera was abandoned the sun broke through the clouds for an instant and this striking picture was obtained 234 Flathead dance Eliminating the environment one would suppose that a party of plains Indians were performing The costumes the step the gesture the character of songs all evidence of the Flathead war dance 235 Flathead childhood 236 By the river Flathead 237 Kalispel type 238 Dusty dress Kalispel The Kalispel young woman Skohlpba is garbed in a dress ornamented with shells that imitate elk tusks The braids of hair are wound with strips of otter fur and a weasel skin dangles from each The bands of white on the hair are effected with white clay 239 Village of the Kalispel The Kalispel who now number about a hundred are scattered along the eastern side of the Pend d Oreille river in eastern Washington In the summer they assemble in their picturesque village consisting of a few wooden houses and a dozen or more canvas covered tipis at the edge of a camas meadow opposite the town of Cusick 240 Kalispel scene From time out of mind the Kalispel have been boatmen and they are one of the few inland tribes that still possess and use craft of native manufacture Their canoes are made of pine bark on a framework of cedar strips the seams and the imperfections of the bark being caulked with spruce gum 241 Spokan man 242 On Spokane River Spokane river from a short distance below its head in Coeur d Alene lake to its confluence with the Columbia flows through the midst of what was the territory of the Spokan Indians The character of the country through which the stream passes for some miles above its mouth is well shown in the picture Northward from the stream lie the mountains among which the three Spokan tribes hunted deer and gathered their supplies of roots 243 Spokan camp The scene is the narrow bench some hundreds of feet above the level of Spokane river on its northern bank and a few miles above its confluence with the Columbia 244 Nespilim man The Nespilim were a small Salishan band living north of the Columbia in the valley of Nespilim river Few representatives of the tribe survive 245 Nespilim woman 246 Nespilim girl In the early years of the nineteenth century various explorers noted that the bands dwelling along the upper course of the Columbia among which the Nespilim were included wore practically no clothing Excepting as the cold made some protection necessary The hair of the women was arranged in two knots at the sides of the face a method of hairdressing still in vogue among the Salish on Fraser river Prior to the middle of the century the use of deerskin garments had become common and gradually other customs such as the style of hairdressing here illustrated were borrowed from the tribes east of the Rocky mountains 247 Luqaiot Kittitas The original of this portrait is a son Owhi Ohai who as chief of the Salishan band inhabiting Kittitas valley Washington at first appeared to favor the Stevens treaty of 1855 but a few months later was drawn into the Indian uprising by the act of another son Qahlchun in killing some prospectors At the termination of hostilities Luqaiot made his permanent home among the Spokan taking for his wife the daughter of a Spokan chief and widow of his executed brother Qahlchun Luqaiot s recollections of the events of these times will be found scattered through the account of the Yakima war in Volume VII 248 Country of the Kutenai The Kutenai occupied portions of southeastern British Columbia northern Idaho and northwestern Montana In this region of blue mountain girt lakes and majestic rivers they very naturally made use of canoes The commoner form was the pine bark craft still to be observed among the Kalispel see plates 239 240 but occasionally they made canoes of the form here illustrated by stretching fresh elk hides over a framework of fir strips or tough saplings The one seen in the picture is a canvas covered specimen found on the shore of Flathead lake in 1909 249 Kutenai duck hunter In the gray dawn of a foggy morning the hunter crouches in his canoe among the rushes waiting for the water fowl to come within range 250 Embarking Kutenai The picture was made near the southern end of Flathead lake in northwestern Montana 251 On the shore of the lake Kutenai The distant foothills of the Rocky mountains occupy the background 252 Crossing the lake Kutenai 253 Kutenai girls 254 Kutenai camp The scene is a thinly wooded sandy peninsula at the southern end of Flathead lake Here the author s camp was pitched in 1909 during some weeks of investigation into the primitive life of the Kutenai 255 Rush gatherer Kutenai Rushes gathered in swamps and in the shallows of the lakes were dried and strung together into mats which primitively were used for lodge covers mattresses canoe cushions and for a variety of domestic purposes",
