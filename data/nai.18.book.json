north but in the southerly Chipewyan area such products occur in fair abundance Besides two species of blueberries two of cranberries and service berries various other fruits were harvested and cattail roots tule root stalks bast from the bark of aspens and pines and lichens were universally held in regard ARTS AND INDUSTRIES For their tools and utensils the Chipewyan employed bone horn antler tooth skin and wood The bow was of willow or birch recurved and strengthened by a sinew wrapping The arrow shaft usually of spruce was tipped with a cylindrical bone point or with an antler point socketed in the shaft The quiver was the entire fur of a fox coyote or otter Spears for killing swimming caribou and beaver for fishing and for fighting had points of moose shin bone or of moose or caribou antler The aboriginal knife is said to have been made of moose antler The adz was a stone blade lashed with rawhide to a wooden handle and a similar hook consisted of a beaver maxilla with a single incisor in place The gaff was a sharp tine of caribou antler lashed to a curved handle and the fish hook a double pointed spindle of the same material fastened at its middle to an untwisted rawhide cord The flesher for preparing hides is a moose ulna beveled at the lower end and the hair scraper a longitudinal half section of an ulna The preparation of skins for clothing shelter fish lines snares sleds and snowshoes was among the most important duties of women in this land where rigorous winter follows close upon fleeting summer The instrument for sewing was a bone awl and the thread of course was sinew Various kinds of skin bags were made for containing dried food and valuables Cordage was either sinew or a continuous thong of caribou rawhide the babiche or shaganappi of Canadian vernacular Some if not all of the northern Athapascans made net cordage of willow bark In the southerly area birch bark was the material for water pails platters berry baskets and cooking vessels In other localities water tight baskets were made of spruce roots Poplar knurls were fashioned into bowls In the far north spoons and ladles were made of musk ox horns Fire was kindled by means of a wooden spindle twirled between the palms and by striking two stones together Tradition points to the use of skin covered canoes but the earliest observers saw only birch bark craft For winter transportation there was the sled consisting of two narrow parallel boards up curving at the front and rigidly joined by wooden cross bars In emergency a toboggan was made by sewing together as many caribou leg skins as were required the short smooth hair glided over the ice with little friction Women usually furnished the motive power for sled transport though the use of dogs was not unknown Every individual of course had his netted snowshoes They were longer and narrower than the Cree type GAMES The gambling contests of the Chipewyan include the hand game a dice play in which four bear claws plugged with lead originally no doubt with sand and gum were employed and the rod game Contests of skill were the ball and pin game in which the object was to impale with a bone pin as many as possible of eight sections of caribou toes and various games of archery and javelin casting Mackenzie observed that the Chipewyan seldom sang and danced that they shot at marks and played at games but preferred to sleep because the task of obtaining food was so arduous that they were glad to rest in idleness POLITICAL AND SOCIAL ORGANIZATION The Chipewyan consisted of local bands wandering here and there in quest of food each under the leadership of the man who by common consent was best fitted to be chief They had neither clans nor totems and the concept of descent as being either maternal or paternal is foreign to their thought Names are not ancestral Feminine names frequently refer to marten and formerly an adult was commonly spoken of as the father or mother of a certain pet dog or a child MARRIAGE Girls were married soon after puberty If the match was made by negotiation between the respective parents payment was made to the girl s father but informal mating was not uncommon The young couple are said to have made their home indiscriminately with either family but the fact that a man looked upon his son in law as the support of his old age points to the young man s joining his wife s family as the regular procedure The familiar mother in law taboo did not here prevail Polygyny was customary for men of ability and the first wife s younger sisters

snaring moose with rawhide ropes suspended in their trails was learned from the Shuswap In stalking this animal the hunter of today is exceptionally wary When the moose bolts at an unavoidable sound if it happens to run against the wind the hunter can only follow and start it up again When it runs across the wind he lies in ambush a few hundred yards on the lee side of its track knowing that the moose will soon swerve back to run with the wind and with good luck the animal will pass within shooting distance From time to time moose used to become very abundant then an epidemic would reduce their numbers John Englishman witnessed such an epidemic and his grandfather told him of similar occurrences The band at Nordegg reported in 1925 that many moose were dying Fish were caught with bone hooks and in traps and were shot with arrows The art of tickling trout was known Many edible berries and roots were harvested the vegetal staple being service berries A native informant paints a doleful picture of the struggle for existence The Assiniboin he says did not understand the art of driving buffalo over a cut bank or into a corral but a certain man instructed for a price by the Blackfeet built a pound in the northern country east of Hobbema He had a buffalo stone and the buffalo songs and was twice successful but a woman in her periods went to the corral and got some meat and thereafter they could not drive the buffalo in The Assiniboin had few horses and only with a superior animal could buffalo be shot down with bow and arrow Their first guns were flintlocks and firing them from a running horse on a winter s day was difficult for the powder would be shaken or blown from the pan For a long time guns and ammunition were decidedly scarce In the fall they would take their furs to Edmonton in later years to Rocky Mountain House but the ammunition they could afford to purchase was always insufficient for the year Moose and elk they could kill with arrows only when the snow in the mountains was very deep The difficulty of getting in on snowshoes and packing out any great quantity of meat made this a doubtful source of food supply It would seem to have been possible for a large number of men even handicapped with a paucity of horses and those not of the best speed to surround a small herd of buffalo and thus in the course of a summer and fall lay up enough meat to carry the band through the winter But apparently they spent so much time getting furs and taking them to the posts in exchange for a few pitiful commodities that they had little left for laying up supplies There were not infrequent periods of comparative starvation The northern Assiniboin traded mainly furs and deerskins while the Blackfoot tribes dealt principally in pemmican and tallow 1 Accepting the truth of this statement we must conclude that Alexander Henry referred to the southern Assiniboin in the following passage It is supposed that these people are the most expert and dexterous nation of the plains in constructing pounds and in driving buffalo into them The pounds are of different dimensions according to the number of tents in one camp The common size is from 60 to 100 paces or yards in circumference and about five feet in height Trees are cut down laid upon one another and interwoven with branches and green twigs small openings are left to admit the dogs to feed upon the carcasses of the bulls which are generally left as useless This inclosure is commonly made between two hummocks on the declivity or at the foot of rising ground The entrance is about ten paces wide and always fronts the plains On each side of this entrance commences a thick range of fascines the two ranges spreading asunder as they extend to the distance of IOO yards beyond which openings are left at intervals but the fascines soon become more thinly planted and continue to spread apart to the right and left until each range has been extended about 300 yards from the pound The labor is then diminished by only placing at intervals three or four cross sticks in imitation of a dog or other animal these extend on the plain for about two miles and double rows of them are planted in several other directions to a still greater distance Young men are usually sent out to collect and bring in the buffalo a tedious task which requires great patience for the herd must be started by slow degrees This is done by setting fire to dung or grass Three young men will bring in a herd of several hundred from a great distance When the wind is aft it is most favorable as they can then direct the buffalo with great ease Having come in sight of the ranges they generally drive the herd faster until it begins to enter the ranges where a swift footed person has been stationed with a buffalo robe over his head to imitate that animal but sometimes a horse performs this business When he sees buffaloes approaching he moves slowly toward the pound until they appear to follow",

said that it was to be mine His brother however took both me and the horse and ran away south to Old Man river When I was about three he went back north to trade at Rocky Mountain House My old grandmother a Cree was tanning hides there for the traders The buffalo horse died and my uncle put me into my grandmother s tipi and went away One of the first things I can remember is that my grandmother packed six dogs and started south I herded them and used to fall down in the deep snow and cry The dogs were large and strong half wolf When I was very tired I would climb on the back of one and ride My grandmother worked hard She was all alone She trapped small animals like marten She used to trade three marten skins not of the best quality for a dollar My first work was chopping wood a small boy at the post and for that I would get a bit of food My clothing was a deerskin shirt tied together in front where it gaped open and leggings of wizi skin from a smoke blackened tipi cover I never see a black stovepipe elbow without remembering my leggings They were stiff and baggy at the knees and black There was a young Englishman a boat maker for the company married to a half breed This woman asked my grandmother if she might take me to Edmonton Chaba ghedn ti beaver timber small house to work as her slave We went in the boat and I worked at chopping wood and such things for my food and clothing After a year I returned to my grandmother I made this journey four times and the last time went as far as Winnipeg with a Red River cart The Englishman used to tell me that my people would become civilized and that some day there would be no buffalo I could not believe it When I got back to Edmonton a Hudson s Bay Company man asked me to accompany him to Bow river There were sixty carts On the north side of Bow river near the present agency they built a sawmill John Macdougal 1 and his brother were building two earth covered cabins He was a missionary his brother a free trader There were three large camps Sarsi Blackfoot and Assiniboin him then he sets off at full speed imitating a buffalo as well as he can with the herd after him The young men in the rear now discover themselves and drive the herd on with all possible speed There is always a sentinel on some elevated spot to notify the camp when the buffalo appear and this intelligence is no sooner given than every man woman and child runs to the ranges that lead to the pound to prevent the buffalo from taking a wrong direction There they lie down between the fascines and cross sticks and if the buffalo attempt to break through the people wave their robes which causes the herd to keep on or turn to the opposite side where other persons do the same When the buffalo have been thus directed to the entrance of the pound the Indian who leads them rushes into it and out at the other side either by jumping over the inclosure or creeping through an opening left for that purpose The buffalo tumble pell mell at his heels almost exhausted but keep moving around the inclosure from E to W and never in a direction against the sun What appeared extraordinary to me on those occasions was that when word was given to the camp of the near approach of the buffalo the dogs would skulk away from the pound and not approach until the herd entered Many buffaloes break their legs and some their necks in jumping into the pound as the descent is generally six or eight feet and stumps are left standing there The buffalo being caught the men assemble at the inclosure armed with bows and arrows every arrow has a particular mark of the owner and they fly until the whole herd is killed Then the men enter the pound and each claims his own but commonly there is what they term the master of the pound who divides the animals and gives each tent an equal share reserving nothing for himself But in the end he is always the best provided for everyone is obliged to send him a certain portion as it is in his tent that the numerous ceremonies relating to the pound are observed There the young men are always welcome to feast and smoke and no women are allowed to enter as that tent is set apart for the affairs of the pound Horses are sometimes used to collect and bring in buffalo but this method is less effectual than the other besides it frightens the herds and soon causes them to withdraw to a great distance When horses are used the buffalo are absolutely driven into the pound but when the other method is pursued they are in a manner enticed to their destruction Coues II 518 520 1 The

blankets and furs to a Blackfoot for a good horse and I went south with a party of hunters I was fourteen My first hunt was just as we were arriving at High river The scouts reported a herd of cows That night I could not sleep I knew I was going to chase buffalo on my own horse It was winter In the morning a warm wind came across the mountains It was a fine day My uncle brother of the man who had taken me away gave me a bow and some arrows and told me what to do He rode at my side and forced me up to the herd I was afraid to go so close When we were close he told me to shoot I let an arrow go and it sank nearly out of sight just behind the ribs of a fat cow She ran a short distance and fell down with blood coming out of her mouth I found that my arrow had nearly passed out on the other side I was proud I thought how I would tell grandmother about it The next hunt was on a cold day The hunters selected only the hardiest men but they included me because I had been so long travelling among strange people that I knew how to take care of myself We ran our horses down a steep hill and most of them fell Mine kept his feet and I let an arrow fly It was so cold that I had no feeling in my hands But I killed a cow The next hunt we started from High river toward Calgary Scouts had reported that Mina washijubi knife white people Americans wafhiju a terrifying object were there and two of us started for the post to see them We stopped to drink at a place where snow and ice were melting Unobserved my bag of ammunition dropped into the pool Toward evening we saw a bull resting We were hungry We could not find a bullet to load our gun I told my friend that I would kill the buffalo with my long double pointed knife He advised me not to try it But I saw that there was a clump of strong willows near the sleeping bull and felt that I would be safe I crept up very quietly and sank my knife in behind his ribs then sprang among the willows The bull leaped up and ran round and round vomiting blood Soon he fell I heard my comrade yelling with excitement that now we had meat He was in a tree We cut out some ribs and the tongue and ate In the morning we went on to the camp When they saw our wolf and marten furs they spoke kindly to us We traded for tobacco and ammunition In my boyhood the whole band was nearly starving one winter We were near Buffalo lake We could not find game except rabbits and a few jumping deer By short stages we moved southward Every day the hunters were out from morning until dark For ten days we had nothing to eat We thought some enemy tribe was keeping the animals from us by sorcery Wolf Tail one evening came in and said he had killed a cow elk Only the very strongest men could walk to the place They brought in the meat The old people

strength again and were able to find some game So we came to life again In those times we had almost no horses and could not pack much provender about And we always thought that there would be plenty

compound curve was effected by binding a block at the middle and another on the opposite side near each end and permitting the green wood to dry A few men had bows of mountain sheep horn which was boiled split shaped and joined at the handhold with glue and sinew Arrows had shafts of service berry shoots three feathers of eagle partridge or duck buffalo sinew wrappings spruce gum glue points of buffalo rib or flint The straightener was a perforated bone the smoother a pair of flat grooved stones the quiver of tanned deerskin or an otter fur was attached to the leather bow case An elk antler tine on a wooden shaft formed an effective dagger and the war club was a hide covered stone on a wooden handle Circular rawhide shields were made Hides were fleshed with the beveled edge of an elk s ulna and the hair was removed by scraping with a sharpened rib The sewing awl was a pointed bone The spear for fishing had three barbless wooden tines the hook was a bone bent after softening in hot water the line twisted inner fibre of willow bark The trap consisted of a stone wing along the outer edge of a river pool nearly touching the bank at the lower end and in this narrow opening a sloping

does to the Saulteurs This game is played in the following manner They have a hoop about two feet in diameter nearly covered with dressed leather and trimmed with quill work feathers bits of metal and other trinkets on which are certain particular marks Two persons play at the same time by rolling the hoop and accompanying it one on each side when it is about to fall each gently throws one arrow in such manner that the hoop may fall upon them and according to that mark on the hoop which rests upon the arrows they reckon the game They also play another game by holding some article in one hand or putting it into one of two shoes the other hand or shoe being empty The platter is now very common among them They have another game which requires 40 to 50 small sticks as thick as a goose quill and

no clans nor was there a system of age societies But the fraternity of Braves or Soldiers was thoroughly established This group of young men known for their courage and recklessness occupied a lodge in the centre of a tribal camp Such men necessarily had waka mystery medicine the symbol of which they wore in the same manner as the Plains Indians for example a bird skin on the head or a buffalo hide shield painted in a particular manner These Agichidebi 1 were unmarried and spent practically all their indoor hours in the society lodge In case of disturbance in camp it was their duty to restore order Should anyone resist their efforts to separate disputants they would have the right to kill and cut him to pieces and each one would eat a small piece of the flesh Though proof and disproof are lacking acquaintance with Indian practice induces one to conclude that the society probably cultivated fear by occasionally pretending to kill and eat a victim Another way of showing their fearlessness was to mix human and dog excrement and devour it or pretend to do so Each member was supposed to have been told by his spirit tutelar at what age he should marry Should he do so before that time he would not live long and would at once lose the power of his helper After marrying the power left him and he was no longer a member of the society Should an enemy be heard or seen near the camp the younger Agichidebi were sent to scout If the enemy attacked or came close they rushed out wearing the symbols of their wak6 and led the fighting They were supposed to be absolutely fearless and never to take thought of the consequence of their recklessness If enemies were to entrench themselves on a hilltop they would rush up and leap among them armed only with knives and daggers The term Agichid6 is said to refer to the following custom One of the society entirely naked would suddenly appear in the midst of the camp and dance while shaking his rattle and singing and looking down intently at himself and particularly at his phallus This signified that he was unashamed and reckless Such a man would be chosen 1 Singular Agichide look at yours the object referred to

be offered the mixture of dung and admonished to prove his courage If he failed to eat he was discredited There is a story about a man who actually killed himself trying to eat what was put before him It is said that the rivals sometimes came into actual conflict and one killed the other When the chief of the society was ready to retire because of age or of a desire to marry he selected a comrade to take his place and gave him his fetish as a loan The new chief with the approval of his fellows selected a brave young man to take the place he had vacated and these two the new member and the new leader danced in the reckless unashamed manner mentioned above Should the retiring chief get into difficulty and feel the need of his medicine he would borrow it back from his successor At his death the fetish became the property of his successor Membership in the society was conferred only by the action of the members The society was defunct about the year I860 but surviving members were still ready to prove their fearlessness About that time there was an Assiniboin camp of ten lodges of buffalo hunters on the prairie near Red Deer river east of Red Deer There were only five guns The Cree were living north of this place near Edmonton Our hunters had been successful and were well pleased One evening we saw some strangers ride up The women and children were sent into the bush and there was much excitement When the riders came up it was seen that they were Sarsi They said Look out there toward the east We looked and saw a camp of several hundred lodges The Sarsi said they were Bloods and there were four Braves among them They warned us not to cease watching They went on Soon we saw about fifty mounted men coming They stopped near by and tied their horses Suddenly we heard the sound of bells We saw a naked man all painted come from behind the crowd He stood between the two parties and rode up and down singing and boasting how he was a Brave and was going to kill all the Assiniboin My uncle said to his companions There is only one hope Let us kill this one before the other three come As he raised his gun the Bloods ran to their horses and began to mount He fired and we could see the bullet strike the Brave in the side His horse leaped away into the bush As it disappeared we could see that he was hanging by one leg Afterward we learned from the Bloods that the horse raked him off No attempt was made to recover his body Some wished to scalp him but one a friend of the missionaries dissuaded them Soon after this the Bloods broke camp and moved away At Eagle hill about fifteen miles west of Olds was a camp of a hundred Assiniboin lodges Six Piegan tipis came from the south to trade deer guts dry meat and pemmican They camped among us Our chief Walking

him Roller was near by and mistaking him for a Piegan raised his gun and pulled the trigger It missed fire Then he saw who it was He fixed his flint Just then a Piegan came out and Agichide fired He broke the Piegan s arm Another Piegan ran out and Bobtail Buffalo shot The man fell crying out His arms were spread his face was on the snow That man sitting there John Englishman was a young man He came and took the dead man s leggings otter neck piece and mirror pendant On all sides I heard the war cry and death songs Guns were banging The other Piegan men ran into the bush Bear s Paw and another were trying to quiet the people Without arms they walked to the Piegan who were pointing their guns and warning them to stop But they said Keep quiet We are going to save you They went on and assembled the Piegan and after a time the Assiniboin became quiet The wounded man died Just before the fighting began the Piegan chief had been invited to the lodge of Spotted Calf When the shooting started Spotted Calf hid him under a blanket and after quiet was restored he put him on a good horse and led him away from the camp The others were taken a safe distance and sent home The four Braves

tents so much had smallpox reduced that once numerous tribe but their numbers are now increasing fast They are arrant beggars whose haughty souls cannot brook the idea of refusal They resent our supplying the Columbia Indians with arms and ammunition Still they boast of never having murdered one of us or stolen any of our horses The country which the Piegans call their own and which they have been known to inhabit since their first intercourse with traders on the Saskatchewan is as I have already observed along the foot of the Rocky mountains on Bow river and even as far S as the Missouri The buffalo regulates their movements over this vast extent of prairie throughout the year as they must keep near these animals to obtain food In summer they are obliged to assemble in large camps of from 100 to 200 tents the better to defend themselves from enemies In winter when there is not so much danger they disperse in small camps of 10 to 20 tents make pounds for buffalo and hunt wolves and kits There are 30 to 40 tents who seldom resort to the plains either in summer or winter unless scarcity of animals or some other circumstance obliges them to join their countrymen This small band generally inhabit the thick woody country along the foot of the mountains where they kill a few beavers and being industrious they are of course better provided for than those Piegans who dwell in the plains The latter despise labor and will not kill a beaver or any other fur animal to enable them to purchase an ax or other European utensil though beaver are numerous in every stream throughout their country They frankly avow that war women liquor and horses are all their delight Many families are still destitute of either a kettle or an ax The women who are mere slaves have much difficulty in collecting firewood Those who have no axes fasten together the ends of two long poles which two women then hook over dry limbs of large trees and thus break them off They also use lines for the same purpose a woman throws a line seven or eight fathoms long over a dry limb and jerks it until the limb breaks off Others again set fire to the roots of large trees which having burned down the branches supply a good stock of fuel The trunk is seldom attacked by those who have axes as chopping blisters their hands Kettles are very scarce particularly among those who dwell in the plains They generally roast their meat on a wooden spit before the fire or broil it on coals The paunch of the buffalo or other animals serves to contain water They are not nice or clean in their cooking They have no particular hour for meals all day meat of some kind is on the fire Their culinary utensils are few and very rough Wooden dishes of different dimensions are made of aspen or poplar knots spoons are formed of the same material or more commonly of buffalo s or ram s horn Some of the latter are very large holding about two quarts and answer as both dish and spoon They are seldom entirely out of food for they keep a stock of dried provisions on hand for emergencies as buffalo sometimes disappear and it may be several days before they can get a fresh supply When they are reduced to dried provisions they call it starving So much do these people abhor work that to avoid the trouble of making proper pounds they seek some precipice along the bank of the river to which they extend their ranks and drive the buffalo headlong over it If not killed or entirely disabled from the fall the animals are generally so much bruised as to be easily dispatched with the bow and arrow But this method sometimes proves dangerous for if the leading buffalo on coming to the edge of the precipice is not entirely exhausted she may refuse to make the leap suddenly turn about and break through the ranks followed by the whole herd carrying before them everything which offers to obstruct their progress No effort of man suffices to arrest a herd in full career after the cow that leads them and thus lives are sometimes lost as the natives standing near the precipice to form the ranks and see the buffalo tumble down have no time to get out of the way The ordinary dress of these people is plain and simple like that of all other Meadow Indians plain leather shoes leather leggings reaching up to the hip and a robe over all constitutes their usual summer dress though occasionally they wear an open leather shirt which reaches down to the thigh Their winter dress differs little from that of the summer their shoes are then made of buffalo hide dressed in the hair and sometimes a leather shirt and a strip of buffalo or wolf skin is tied around the head They never wear mittens I have frequently seen them come in to our houses after a I0 or 15 days march over the plains in the depth of winter with the thermometer 30 to 40 degrees below zero dressed with only shoes leggings and a robe nothing else to screen them from the cold War seems to be the Piegans sole delight their

one end of a lake near Chief mountain Ninnaastakuyi He hunted on foot and when he returned his wife was not there He spent two days searching for her He thought I will search no more But I will wait four days and if she does not come back I will go On the fourth day at sunrise he heard someone singing in a low tone The sound came from the south He did not look out The sound passed to the west to the north to the east It came into his tipi There were three men and the missing woman The man who had taken the woman away had a bundle of beaver skins He laid it at the back of the lodge One said My companion gives you these skins The Beaver men instructed White Finger in the songs that pertained to the bundle The woman had already learned them in her sojourn among the Beavers After the Beaver men had gone White Finger and his wife came back northward to their people carrying the bundle on a dog drawn travois When they showed the bundle of skins the people said This man has something wonderful At his tipi it was necessary to be very quiet and especially to avoid any knocking sounds as one would do in the vicinity of a beaver colony The skins and the man and the woman were painted red When a pipe was offered to them the head was presented first not the stem and they rested the bowl on the ground when they smoked They used red paint and blue paint A Blackfoot friend of this man went to the trading post at Edmonton and obtained some tobacco He returned and sent a messenger to White Finger offering him tobacco for half of the beaver skins Some time later the two tribes met in a large camp The Blackfoot visited White Finger and said Did you receive the message I sent you offering tobacco for half of your skins I have also six dogs and I will give you three of them His friend agreed and divided the bundle and took half of the skins to the Blackfoot s lodge in the same way that the Beaver had brought the bundle to him He gave him instruction in the songs and taboos The Blackfoot asked Are you going to plant tobacco next year If you are wait for me We are going apart now and I will collect all the meat back fat and berries I can In the spring the Blackfoot sent word to White Finger to wait for him so that they might plant together As he journeyed he met a man who told him that the Piegan had already planted his tobacco The news depressed him He turned back and camped alone with his own band on Red Deer river He went up on a small hill and sat there very downcast He was facing north He noticed some snowbirds flitting about him They sang Sleep where our children are Have pity on them They have power He slept and when he woke he looked in a clump of buckbrush and found the nest of the snowbirds They told him to plant tobacco beside the nest He

and held them pointed upward and forward while they danced The three leaders were always old men The Black Soldiers originated in the dream of a Blackfoot man Each member wore a wolf skin head band with two feathers upright at each side and wolf skin anklets and wristlets The body and limbs were painted red and there was a black band across the forehead and the chin On the cheeks were two black lines representing the wolf s canine teeth He bore a long spear tipped staff painted red and having wolf skin strips hanging from it The leader had in addition a wolf skin draped from his shoulders The Black Soldiers danced in a circular crowd moving slowly in a circle stepping high uttering wolf cries at the end of their songs the leader outside the throng and moving in the opposite direction They shook their spears in a minatory manner If any member was absent they danced four times making motions with the spears in the direction of his tipi and then rushed upon it and cut up everything belonging to him tipi clothing and whatever was there They were camp police in the large encampments If they warned the people that nobody leave camp they pursued anyone who disobeyed and capturing him cut up his clothing and then returned to destroy his tipi A thoughtful provision was that if the pursued being surrounded dismounted and drew a line on the ground about himself none could enter this symbolic entrenchment except a man who in war had performed a similar feat If such a one were present and came to the attack the besieged had only to make his blanket into a bundle and toss it to the enemy The Black Soldiers then withdrew without molesting him and without even harming the blanket Or the pursued could take refuge in the water because wolves which the Black Soldiers represented abhor water and none could go after him except one who had killed an enemy in the water a rather remote chance If he ran into a tipi only one who had entered a tipi to kill an enemy or capture booty could follow him and he could only take the blanket and destroy it This also very rarely happened Old men invariably say with great positiveness that the Soldiers would cut up everything tipi clothing medicine robe anything Closely questioned however two old men one of whom was formerly a member the other of whom frequently saw the Black Soldiers in action were able to recall only a single occasion when anything of this kind happened A man who had once entered an enemy lodge followed a fugitive into a tipi brought out his blanket and tossed it to his companions who cut it up In no other way did they molest the culprit On another occasion they saw the Black Soldiers fling a man into the water because he had failed to attend a meeting of the society Both informants have frequently seen the Black Soldiers destroy the tipi and the personal clothing of negligent members In view of the various means provided for the escape of non members and the frequency of punishment meted out to members it appears that these latter occasions were deliberately arranged for the purpose of impressing the populace The informants however deny that such was the case Asked to explain how any member could be such a fool as to risk the loss of so much valuable property difficult to replace they reply that sometimes a man did not want to dance and deliberately absented himself Probably if such was the case these episodes were the result of",

one of several Athapascan groups occupying the territory between the Hudson bay and the Rocky mountains from about the fifty seventh parallel to the Arctic circle Much of this area is barren but the streams that feed and drain the innumerable lakes are bordered by thick groves of the slender white boles of aspens whose pleasant glades are favored by camps of fishermen and berrypickers The Chipewyan dwelling formerly made of the skins of caribou on which animal these people principally depended for food clothing and shelter was one of the few points in which their culture resembled that of the plains Indians Their distinctive garment was a leather or fur coat with skirts cut to a point before and behind a feature to which the appellation Wichipwayaniwuk they pointed fur people the Cree original of Chipewyan alluded 617 Titishu kghitluhl Deer Running The Sarsi are an Athapascan tribe which prior to the nineteenth century came out of the far north crossed the Saskatchewan and becoming affiliated with the Algonquian confederacy of the Bloods Blackfeet and Piegan became typical plainsmen following the buffalo engaging in horse stealing raids and in general adopting the religious practices of their allies Old Sarsi as the subject of this plate is colloquially known was ninety eight years of age when the photograph was made in 1925 In spite of his years he was still agile and keen 618 Tsaaassi mis salla Crow with Necklace Sarsi The name colloquially rendered as Crow Collar refers to a neck ornament of crow feathers 619 Muwu His Tooth Sarsi The childhood nickname His Tooth completely supplanted the formally bestowed Star Child 620 A Sarsi camp The scene is a riverside grove near Okotoks Alberta where a band of Sarsi were awaiting clement weather to begin the prosaic labor of shocking wheat for one of their Caucasian neighbors 621 A Cree canoe on Lac Les Isles The Western Woods Cree Bush Cree Swampy Cree or Maskegon as they are variously known are scattered in numerous bands through the wooded country north of the prairies between Hudson bay and the Peace river drainage Other members of this large family inhabit the plains in Manitoba Saskatchewan and Alberta and the country from Lake Winnipeg to Lakes Mistassini and Nitchequon in the Province of Quebec They are members of the great Algonquian stock and are closely related to the Chippewa Lac les Isles locally known as Big Island lake is in west central Saskatchewan near the Alberta border The canoe is a well made craft of birch bark 622 A Cree girl The garment here illustrated is a robe of twined strips of rabbit fur 623 Moose hunter Cree Cree hunters are masters of their art of imitating by means of a birch bark trumpet the call of a moose of either sex and thus luring within gunshot an animal seeking a mate during the rutting season 624 Cree tipis 625 Moss for the baby bags Cree In moist localities of the northern bush country the ground is thickly carpeted with Sphagnum The moss is dried on racks and is used as an absorbent in the tightly laced bags of infants 626 A Cree Of variously widely differing types noted among the Cree at Lac les Iles the subject of this plate and that of the following one were perhaps best representative of Cree physiognomy 627 A Cree woman 628 A Cree camp at Lac les Isles A family group consisting of two middle aged women a young mother and several children camped at the lake while the rest of the band were haying in a swampy meadow some miles inland They engaged in fishing with a gill net and in gathering blueberries In point of sanitation their tipi and their cooking methods left much to be desired 629 Chief Hector Assiniboin The Assiniboin are an offshoot of the Yanktonai Sioux from whom they separated prior to 1640 The southern branch has long been confined on a reservation in Montana the northern is resident in Alberta The latter is divided into two bands which formerly ranged respectively north and south of Bow river from the Rocky mountains out upon the prairies Hector is chief of the southern band of the Canadian branch known locally as Bear s Paw band 630 Assiniboin hunter 631 Kindling fire Assiniboin The fire drill is unknown to the oldest Assiniboin traditionists but striking fire from flint was apparently as aboriginal method 632 Assiniboin mother and child 633 Painted tipi Assiniboin A tipi painted with figurines commemorative of a dream experienced by its owner is a venerated object Its occupants enjoy good fortune and there is no difficulty in finding a purchaser when after a few years the owner according to custom decides to dispose of it 634 Placating the spirit of a slain eagle Assiniboin For their feathers which were used in many ways as ornaments and as fetishes eagles were caught by a hunter concealed in a brush covered pit A rather elaborate ceremony took place over the bodies of the slain birds for the purpose of placating the eagle spirits The Sarsi custom is described at some length in Volume XVIII pages 95 99 635 Agichide Assiniboin 636 Blackfoot country Since the beginning of the historical period the Blackfeet have ranged the prairies along Bow river while their allies the Bloods and Piegan were respectively on Belly and Old Man rivers In the earliest times of which their traditionists have knowledge the three tribes were respectively on Saskatchewan Red Deer and Bow rivers 637 A Blackfoot travois The travois is still used for transporting bundles of ceremonial objects Before and sometimes even long after the acquisition of horses travoix were drawn by dogs 638 Medicine headdress Blackfoot By long usage the term medicine in the sense of supernatural has become firmly fixed in the literature of American Indians and especially the plains tribes A head dress of the sort here depicted consists of some part of the body sometimes the entire skin of the creature that appeared as a spirit in a dream of the wearer and instructed him how to have its help especially in war 639 Oksoyapiw Blackfoot 640 Bear Bull Blackfoot The plate illustrates an ancient Blackfoot method of arranging the hair 641 Calf Child Blackfoot 642 Blackfoot tipis 643 Fleshing a hide Blackfoot The implement for removing flesh and fat from hides is a long bone with a beveled scraping edge The thong attached to the upper end and passing about the woman s wrist is for the purpose of giving additional leverage 644 Bow River Blackfoot 645 Lodge of the Horn Society Blood The Horn society is the custodian of a cult about which the natives are loath to give details It stands apart from the system of age societies which though partly religious in character were more concerned with warfare and the preservation of order in camp Numerous taboos apply to the conduct of Horn members and there are sexual rites in which the wife of a novice and his sponsor participate 646 Sacred bags of the Horn Society Blood 647 Makoyepuk Wolf
