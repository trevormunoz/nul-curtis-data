Mitat Wailaki The Wailaki were a group of loosely connected Athapascan bands occupying the watershed of the North fork of Eel river in northwestern California About two hundred are now quartered with the Yuki on Round Valley reservation 473 Old Ukiah Pomo The Pomo formerly occupied about half the area of Mendocino Sonoma and Lake counties besides a small isolated territory in Glenn and Colusa The survivors are found in greatest number in the vicinity of the town of Ukiah This name though it is applied to the original portrait as a nickname is a word of Pomo origin from yo south and kaia valley 474 Hunter Lake Pomo The scene is Clear lake The abundant tules along its shallows formerly supplied the natives with material for house coverings mats garments and balsas and sheltered teeming flocks of waterfowl 475 Burden basket Pomo With her basket supported bya tump line passing across her head and with seed beater in hand this capable matron is ready for a day in the fields harvesting wild seeds which she will parch and crush into a nutritious and appetizing meal known by the Mexican name pinole 476 Mixed blood Coast Pomo 477 On the shores of Clear Lake 478 Shatila Pomo 479 Summer camp Lake Pomo Except that it was larger and rather more substantial the winter house of the Lake Pomo was identical with its tule covered framework of willow poles 480 Wild grapes Pomo 481 Gathering tules Lake Pomo The round stem tule Scirpus lacustris was used principally for thatching houses for making mats by stringing them laterally on parallel cords and securely lashed together in long bundles in the construction of serviceable and quickly made canoes 482 Pomo girl Clam shell beads of the kind here shown are still made by some of the old men Fragments of shell are pierced and strung on a stem of the scouring rush Equisetum which is then drawn backward and forward on a flat surface of sandstone until the fragments have become nearly circular The feathered ornament is an ear pendant which in this case because of its length and weight is attached to a strand of hair The large dark colored bead on one strand of the necklace is a cylinder of magnesite a highly valued object 483 Coast Pomo woman 484 Pomo seed gathering utensils The group includes a tight mesh burden basket for seeds an open mesh burden basket for acorns and other nuts two winnowing trays and a seed beater with which the seeds are brushed from the plant into the burden basket 485 Pomo baskets mortar and pestle 486 Coast Pomo girl 487 Fishing camp Lake Pomo Large quantities of species locally called black fish are still taken annually by the Lake Pomo The fish are split down the back and after the removal of backbone head and entrails are hung on pole racks to dry in the sun for about two weeks after which they are thoroughly cured in smoke houses Tule huts are not now seen the one here shown having been built especially for the occasion 488 Aged Pomo woman 489 Canoe of tules Pomo In an emergency a craft even more simple than this was made by fashioning a long bundle of tules which the boatman rode astride with his legs in the water 490 Wappo The Wappo were a Yukian group occupying a detached area in the northeastern corner of Sonoma county Only a small band survive in Alexander valley near Healdsburg 491 Wappo woman 492 Otila Maidu Otila otherwise Jack Franco was the principal source of information regarding the Maidu Born at the important village Michopdo in the lowlands of Sacramento river about he year 1845 as a young boy he experienced the untainted native life before the influx of miners and settlers proved the undoing of the Indians As a youth he rode the range for General John Bidwell and his old age he has spent in company with a small group of his people on the Bidwell ranch at Chico 493 Miwok head man 494 Fishing pool Southern Miwok Besides a small district at the southern end of Clear lake and larger territory that included all of Marin and a part of Sonoma county Miwok Indians occupied the western slope of the Sierra Nevada from the summit to the San Joaquin plain and from Fresno river in the south to Cosumnes river in the north The higher regions are veined with brawling mountain brooks which converge into such larger streams as Merced Tuolumne Stanislaus Calaveras adm Mokelumne Yosemite and many of the sequoia groves lie in Miwok territory 495 Southern Miwok 496 Fisherman Southern Miwok 497 Chukchansi Yokuts The Chukchansi one of the northern divisions of the Yokuts occupied the headwaters of Fresno river and the northern tributaries of the San Joaquin in Madera county California 498 Yauelmani Yokuts The Yauelmani formerly lived in the plains north of Kern lake The survivors are on Tule River reservation in Tulare county 499 Art as old as the tree southern Yokuts 500 Rattlesnake design in Yokuts basketry Basketry was the principal and remains the only manufacturing industry of the Yokuts Both the coiled and the twined process are followed but the better baskets and by far the greater number are coiled The examples shown in the plate are coiled and of the kind used for cooking liquid foods by means of heated stones 501 By the pool Tule River Reservation 502 Yokuts basketry designs A 503 Yokuts basketry designs B 504 Chukchansi Yokuts type 505 Chukchansi matron 506 Quiet waters Tule River Reservation Tule River reservation a tract of nearly fifty thousand acres on the edge of the foothills of the Sierra Nevada in Tulare county is the home of about a hundred and fifty Indians practically all of whom are members of the Yokuts family Only a small portion of the reservation is suited to agriculture 507 Yaundanchi Yokuts woman The Yaudanchi formerly controlled the territory about the headwaters of Tule river in Tulare
