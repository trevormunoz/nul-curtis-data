cactus called hasen by the Pima forms a very important source of the food supply of the tribes of southern Arizona This fruit is of about the size of a small pear and is very sweet It is eaten fresh dried or in the form of syrup and a sort of wine is made from its juice In gathering it the natives use a long pole with a wooden blade at the end 41 Pima baskets The baskets made by the Pima Papago and Qahatika as well as by their Maricopa neighbors are practically identical in form and design but the Maricopa basketry is of somewhat superior workmanship The four armed cross a form of the swastika appears as the central feature in the decoration of a majority of the Piman and Maricopa baskets of to day and while the true signification here is not known with certainty it is not impossible that it was designed originally to represent the winds of the four cardinal directions Less than a generation ago the swastika was employed by the Pima to decorate their shields and as a brand for their horses 42 Kaviu Pima The Pima are bright active progressive Indians as the portrait of the typical man of the tribe attests 43 The Burden bearer Pima This illustration shows the typical burden basket of the several Piman tribes of southern Arizona called kiho in the Piman language Their mythology relates that once the kiho was an animate being but owing to disobedience of divine laws when the people emerged from the under world it became inanimate and has since been carried on the backs of women 44 The Pima woman This pictures gives also an idea of the size attained by the giant cactus or saguaro 45 Pima ki The old time round dwelling of the Pima tribes In construction it was much the same as the earth lodge of the tribes of the northern plains the chief difference lying in the fact that its top is practically flat and it is not provided with an opening for the escape of the smoke as well as in the lack of an extended or built out entrance way The ki was usually about 15 feet in diameter As the winter climate of southern Arizona is very mild only a small fire was needed to keep the ki warm in even the coldest weather the smoke from which became absorbed in part by the earthen roof or escaped through the doorway 46 Pima matron A representative Pima woman of middle age 47 Chijako Pima A representative Pima man of middle age 48 Papago girl A particularly fine looking Papago girl of as nearly pure blood as can be found in the region The northern Piman tribes have been in direct contact with Spanish people for more than two centuries Much of the early foreign blood however has become so blended that its physical influence is no longer apparent Indeed there are many instances in which the Indians insist that their blood is entirely aboriginal whereas in fact an infusion of alien blood is traceable several generations back 49 Gathering hanamh Papago Hanamh is the Piman name for the cholla cactus and its fruit The natives gather the fruit of this spiny plant in large quantities and it forms a food of material importance to the several tribes living within its habitat In gathering it they use rude tongs made from a split stick After a basket is filled the fruit is spread on the ground and bushed about with a small stiff besom until the spines are worn off or the spines are burned of in an open fire 50 Carlos Rios Papago chief 51 Facade San Xavier del Bac Mission 52 Portal San Xavier del Bac Mission San Xavier del Bac is one of the most beautiful of the old Southwestern mission churches The mission was founded in 1692 the construction of the present church was commenced in 1783 and finished fourteen years later It has recently been repaired and is in a good state of preservation 53 Luzi Papago The Papago women always carry their burdens on or supported from their heads When the burden be it a basket pottery or a box has a flat or a rounded bottom the ring of the woven yucca is placed on the head in order to give the load a firm position for carrying and to relieve the bearer of pressure 54 Qahatika water girl 55 Resting in the harvest field Qahatika 56 Qahatika girl 57 Mohave chief A representative type of the Mohave men 58 Mohave water carrier A Mohave mother on the bank of the Colorado river The Mohave carry practically all burdens on their heads Being unusually large and strongly built the women thus bear immense loads with apparent ease A woman has been seen to balance on her head a railroad tie of such weight that a strong man could do no more than pick it up and addition a heavy load in each hand 59 Judith Mohave A young Mohave woman about eighteen years of age 60 Quniaika Mohave Although this pictures one of the best of his tribe it serves as well to illustrate a man of the Age of Stone 61 Mosa Mohave It would be difficult to conceive of a more aboriginal than this Mohave girl Her eyes are those of the fawn of the forest questioning the strange things of civilization upon which it gazes for the first time She is such a type as Father Garces may have viewed on his journey through the Mohave country in 1776 62 The Yuma 63 Hwalya Yuma A Yuma girl characteristic of southern Yuman maidenhood 64 Havachachi Maricopa 65 Maricopa girl The young Maricopa women affect the Mexican more than the Indian dress but they are by no means unpicturesque in their garb of many colors as they gracefully bear their burden on their heads 66 Mat Stams Maricopa This individual exhibits strongly the characteristics of the Yuman stock to which he belongs 67 Hipah with arrow brush Maricopa Arrow brush is extensively used by the tribes of this region as a covering for their houses In earlier rime they lived in circular houses constructed of a framework of heavy poles covered with arrow brush and coated with mud In many of the modern rectangular houses also the arrow brush is used bound together closely with withes and plastered on the outside with adobe 68 By the canal Maricopa Earthen utensils of native manufacture are in general use among the Maricopa Large jars are kept in the houses to be filled with a day s supply of water smaller ones are used for conveying water and as cooking utensils 69 Saguaro fruit gatherers Maricopa Like their Piman neighbors the Maricopa gather large quantities of the fruit of the saguaro or giant cactus which they relish in its natural state as well as in the form of wine or preserve 70 Pakit Maricopa 71 Captain Charley Maricopa This portrait shows clearly the strongly Yuman cast of features retained by this branch of the stock 72 Home of the Havasupai The Havasupai dwelling is dome shaped framework of poles sometimes covered with brush and reeds only in other cases banked well toward the top with earth The ca\u00f1on walls shown in the background are of red sandstone and rise perpendicularly four hundred feet Back of these walls extend vast stretches of rough broken country intersected by many ravines and capped by sharp pinnacles This picture was taken in early spring when the peach orchards of the Havasupai were in full blossom 73 Pachilawa Walapai chief 74 Tonovige Havasupai This portrait was made in winter while a party of Havasupai were encamped in the high country above their ca\u00f1on home As a snowstorm was raging at the time the woman s hair became dotted with flakes as the picture reveals",
