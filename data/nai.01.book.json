        "http://memory.loc.gov/award/iencurt/cp01/cp01040v.jpg": "The North American Indian List of Large Plates Supplementing Volume One 1 Vanishing race Navaho The thought which this picture is meant to convey is that the Indians as a race already shorn in their tribal strength and stripped of their primitive dress are passing into the darkness of an unknown future Feeling that the picture expresses so much of the thought that inspired the entire work the author has chosen it as the first of the series 2 Geronimo Apache This portrait of the historical old Apache was made in March 1905 According to Geronimo s calculation he was at the time seventy six years of age thus making the year of his birth 1829 The picture was taken at Carlisle Pennsylvania the day before the inauguration of President Roosevelt Geronimo being one of the warriors who took part in the inaugural parade at Washington He appreciated the honor of being one of those chosen for this occasion and the catching of his features while the old warrior was in a retrospective mood was most fortunate 3 Desert rovers Apache The White Mountain Apache and the desert portion of their country The picture was made on a gray day of early spring when the Apache wear blankets as protection against the keen air of their mountain home 4 Apache land Apache horsewomen in a small valley of the White Mountain region The horses are laden with the complete camp equipage on top of which the women have taken their seats 5 Alchise Apache Chief of the White Mountain Apache A well known character having been a scout with General Crook Colonel Cooley who was chief of scouts under Crook says a braver man than Alchise never lived He was about twenty two when Fort Apache then Camp Ord was established in 1870 making the year of his birth about 1848 This portrait was made at Alchise s camp on White river in the spring of 1903 6 Sigesh Apache This illustrates the girls method of tying the hair previous to marriage The ornament fastened to the hair in the back is made of leather broad and round at the ends and narrow in the middle 7 Apache This picture might be titled Life Primeval It is the Apache as we would mentally picture him in the time of the Stone Age It was made at a spot on Black river Arizona where the dark still pool breaks into the laugh of a rapids 8 Apache reaper Here the Apache woman is seen in her small wheatfield harvesting the grain with a hand sickle the method now common to all Indians of the Southwest 9 Storm Apache A scene in the high mountains of Apache land just before the breaking rainstorm 10 Getting water Apache A picture made in early spring on the banks of White river Arizona The water bottle is the typical Apache one of basketry covered with pinon gum 11 Story telling Apache A story telling group particularly typical of these people The Apache often sit about and exchange stories of the past or of to day 12 Renegade type Apache No picture could better show the old renegade type of the Apache than this one of Genitoa It is the type of Indian who has yielded to the inevitable and lives in peace not because he prefers it but because he must 13 Scout Apache The primitive Apache in his mountain home 14 Morning bath Apache The Apache old and young alike are particularly fond of bathing and make the most of every opportunity to have a swim They call it a swim regardless of how shallow the water may be just so long as they can wash their bodies 15 Apache Nalin An Apache girl about fourteen years of age 16 Eskadi Apache A headman for one of the bands and a particularly fine Apache type 17 Apache babe A fortunate child picture giving a good idea of the happy disposition of Indian children and at the same time showing the baby carrier or holder 18 Chideh Apache 19 Lost trail Apache 20 Vash Gon Jicarilla 21 Chief Garfield Jicarilla Some years ago the Jicarillas were all officially given Spanish or English names Many of them expressed a preference This old man who was head chief of the tribe at the time selected the designation Garfield 22 Jicarilla maiden This pictures exceedingly well the typical Jicarilla women s dress a cape of deerskin beaded a broad belt of black leather a deerskin skirt and the hair fastened at each side of the head with a large knot of yarn or cloth 23 Jicarilla matron 24 Hilltop camp Jicarilla 25 Jicarilla women Women watching the races on their annual ceremonial or feast day It will be observed that they are all dressed uniformly in garments cut after the primitive mode 26 Chief of the desert Navaho Picturing not only the individual but a characteristic member of the tribe disdainful energetic self reliant 27 Women of the desert Navaho The Navaho women are for the greater part the owners of the flocks and invariably with the children the herders They are so thoroughly at home on their scrubby ponies that they seem a part of them and probably excel all other Indians as horsewomen 28 Ca\u00f1on de Chelly Navaho A wonderfully scenic spot is this in northeastern Arizona in the heart of the Navaho country one of their strongholds in fact Ca\u00f1on de Chelly exhibits evidences of having been occupied by a considerable number of people in former times as in every niche at every side are seen the cliff perched ruins of former villages 29 Ca\u00f1on del Muerto Navaho This Ca\u00f1on of the Dead is a branch of Ca\u00f1on de Chelly deriving its name from having been the scene of the massacre of a band of Navaho by a troop of Mexican soldiers 30 At the shrine Navaho Scattered about the Navaho reservation are many cairn shrines The Navaho when alone or in parties on approaching one of these gathers a few twigs of pi\u00f1on or cedar places them on the shrine scatters a pinch of sacred meal upon it and makes supplication for that which he may habitually need or which the moment demands 31 Nesjaja Hatali Navaho A well known Navaho medicine man While in the Ca\u00f1on de Chelly the writer witnessed a very interesting four days ceremony given by the Wind Doctor Nesjaja Hatali was also assistant medicine man in two nine days ceremonies studied one in Ca\u00f1on del Muerto and the other in this portfolio No 39 is reproduced from one made and used by this priest doctor in the Mountain Chant 32 Son of the desert Navaho In the early morning this boy as if springing from the earth itself came to the author s desert camp Indeed he seemed a part of the very desert His eyes bespeak all of the curiosity all of the wonder of his primitive mind striving to grasp the meaning of the strange things about him 33 Navaho flocks The Navaho might as well be called the Keepers of Flocks Their sheep are of the greatest importance to their existence and in the care and management of their flocks they exhibit a thrift not to be found in the average tribe 34 Blanket weaver Navaho The Navaho land blanket looms are in evidence everywhere In the winter months they are set up in the hogans but during the summer they are erected outdoors under an improvised shelter or as in this case beneath a tree The simplicity of the loom and its product are here clearly shown pictured in the early morning light under a large cottonwood 35 Hastobiga Navaho medicine man 36 Point of interest Navaho 37 Out of the darkness Navaho In Tesakod ca\u00f1on a small branch of Ca\u00f1on de Chelly At the point where this picture was made the gorge is very narrow 38 Sunset in Navaho land 39 Alhkidokihi Navaho One of the four elaborate dry paintings or sand altars employed in the rites of the Mountain Chant a Navaho medicine ceremony of nine days duration",
