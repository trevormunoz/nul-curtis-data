foothills of the Rocky Mountains is typical of the western portion of the Piegan country where the undulating upland prairies become rougher and more broken and finally give place abruptly to mountains 185 Morning Eagle Piegan At an age of more than ninety Apinakuipita is still hale enough to ride his horse to the tribal gatherings 186 Painted lodges Piegan Symbolically painted tipis are frequently observed among the Piegan Sometimes incidents in the owner s career especially as a warrior are depicted but more often as in this picture the painting is conventional and imitative of a tipi seen by the owner in a vision 187 Tearing Lodge Piegan Pinokiminush is one of the few Piegan of advanced years and retentive memory He was born about 1835 on Jusdith river in what is now northern Montana and was found to be a valuable informant on many topics The buffalo skin cap is a part of his war costume and was made and worn at the command of a spirit in a vision The first fasting of Tearing Lodge for the sake of experiencing a vision is narrated by him in Volume VI pages 79 81 188 In a Piegan lodge Little Plume with his son Yellow Kidney occupies the position of honor the space at the rear opposite the entrance The picture is full of suggestion of the various Indian activities In a prominent place lie the ever present pipe and its accessories on the tobacco cutting board From the lodge poles hang the buffalo skin shield the long medicine bundle an eagle wing fan and deerskin articles for accoutering the horse The upper end of the rope is attached to the intersection of the lodge poles and in stormy weather the lower end is made fast to a stake near the centre of the floor space 189 White Calf Piegan Unistai poka White Buffalo calf died at Washington in 1903 He was then almost eighty years of age and had been the chief of his tribe for about ageneration In 1855 being then known as Feather he signed the treaty negotiated by Governor Stevens As a warrior White Calf was famous among the tribes but with the passing of inter tribal warfare he devoted himself to working in peaceful ways for the good of his people He was remarkable in the breadth of his judgement and in the readiness with which he recognized and adapted himself to the changes which his people were obliged to face when the buffalo vanished Kindly benevolent and gentle of nature White Calf yet possessed a sturdy determination and independence that bullying and threats could not move Yet if reasons were advanced which appealed to his judgement he was quick to acknowledge error and to modify his views George Bird Grinnell 190 Two Bear Woman Piegan 191 Double Runner Piegan Double Runner s is an excellent type of the Piegan physiognomy as well as the ideal North American Indian as pictured by the average person The native name of this individual is Ahjutomahka 192 Sun dance encampment Piegan This tribal assembly for the Sun Dance of 1898 comprised about two hundred and thirty tipis including a number of visiting Blackfeet and Bloods from Canada The scene is on the Piegan reservation in northern Montana near Browning 193 Travaux Piegan With the most of the plains tribes the travois was the universal vehicle for transporting camp equipment but is now rarely seen In the days before the acquisition of horses a smaller form of the same device was drawn by dogs The occasion of this picture was the bringing of the sacred tongues to the medicine lodge ceremony as narrated in Volume VI page 40 194 Gambler Piegan 195 At the water s edge Piegan 196 Yellow Kidney Piegan The portrait shows Apuyotoksi light colored kidney wearing a wolf skin war bonnet 197 Idle hour Piegan 198 Grizzly bear brave Piegan At least two of the Piegan Warrior societies the Braves and the All Brave Dogs included in their membership two men known as Grizzly bear Braves It was their duty at the time of the society dances to provide their comrades with meat which they appropriated wherever they could find it Their expression and demeanor did justice to their name and in their official capacity they were generally feared by the people See Volume VI pages 20 21 199 Medicine pipe Piegan Medicine pipes of which the Piegan have many are simply long pipe stems variously decorated with beads paint feathers and fur Each one is believed to have been obtained long ago in some supernatural manner as recounted in a myth The medicine pipe is ordinarily concealed in a bundle of wrappings which are removed only when the sacred object is to be employed in healing sickness or when it is to be transferred from one custodian to another in exchange for property Such exchanges occurring at intervals of a few years in the history of each pipe are attended by much ceremony 200 New Chest Piegan 201 Crow Eagle Piegan 202 Middle Calf Piegan 203 Weasel Tail Piegan The accoutrement of this brave Apohsuyis comprises the well known war bonnet of eagle feathers and weasel skins deerskin shirt bone

their warrior fathers 205 Bringing the sweat lodge willows Piegan Young horseman are coming toward the Sun dance encampment with willows for the faster s sweat lodge as described in Volume VI page 43 206 Iron Breast Piegan The picture illustrates the costume of a member of the Bulls see Volume VI page 28 an age society for many years obsolete 207 Piegan encampment The picture not only presents a characteristic view of an Indian camp on an uneventful day but also emphasizes the grand picturesqueness of the Piegan living as they do almost under the shadow of the towering Rocky mountains 208 Piegan dandy 209 Three chiefs Piegan Three proud old leaders of their people A picture of the primal upland prairies with their waving grass and limpid streams A glimpse of the life and conditions which are on the verge of extinction 210 Cheyenne type The original of this portrait is Wako yami his horse bobtailed of the Northern Cheyenne 211 Cheyenne profile 212 Cheyenne girl 213 Two Moons Cheyenne Two Moons was one of the Cheyenne chiefs at the battle of Little Bighorn in 1876 when Custer s command was annihilated by a force of Sioux and Cheyenne 214 At the ford Cheyenne The picture represents a party of warriors on the march The scene is at Tongue river in Montana 215 Camp in the cottonwoods Cheyenne The scene shows a single lodge pitched in one of the cottonwood groves in the bottoms along Tongue river in Montana 216 Porcupine Cheyenne At the summer gatherings for such occasions as the Sun Dance the men sometimes protect their heads from the merciless sun by a thatch of cottonwood leaves 217 Camp in the cottonwoods Cheyenne The scene shows a single lodge pitched in one of the cottonwood groves in the bottoms along Tongue river in Montana 218 Waiting in the forest Cheyenne At dusk in the neighborhood of the large encampments young men closely wrapped in non comittal blankets or white cotton sheets may be seen gliding about the tipis or standing motionless in the shadow of the trees each one alert for the opportunity to steal a meeting with his sweetheart 219 Little Wolf Cheyenne",
