        "http://memory.loc.gov/award/iencurt/cp16/cp16037v.jpg": "The North American Indian List of Large Plates Supplementing Volume Sixteen 544 Taos water girls 545 Iahla Willow Taos 546 North pueblo at Taos Taos consists of two house masses separated by Pueblo creek The entire site was formerly surrounded by a protective wall remains of which are still in place The north structure is called Hlauoma cold elevated referring to its situation north being regarded as up and south as down The other is Hlauqima cold diminish 547 Walvia Medicine Root Taos Walvia is a characteristic type of Taos womanhood 548 Taos woman 549 Isleta man 550 Francisca Chiwiwi Isleta In general an Indian regards his name as a personal possession and does not willingly reveal it to strangers Tact and experience usually overcome this reluctance but in a brief visit at Isleta there seemed to be an understanding that no individual should admit the possession of a Tiwa name Only Spanish names were recorded 551 Jemez architecture On account of the comparative inaccessibility of its site on Rio Jemez a westerly affluent of the Rio Grande Jemez is annoyed by fewer white visitors than almost any other pueblo The reticence and the mental sluggishness of its inhabitants do not encourage the ethnologist The Jemez played a leading part in the rebellion of 1680 and were so severely punished by Vargas that their preference for isolation is comprehensible They have long been intimate with the Navaho and considerable racial mixture has resulted 552 Jemez fiscal The office of fiscal like that of governor and alguacil is of Spanish origin and its incumbents are charged with the supervision of activities connected with the church such as burial of the dead and physical care of the church building In general the church is an institution superimposed on pueblo life it has nowhere become an integral part of it At Jemez several centuries of effort at Christianization have been without tangible result except that the presence of missionaries has been a more or less beneficial object lesson in a better mode of life 553 Tuvahe Jemez 554 Cochiti and Sia pottery The vessel with the bird design was made at Sia the others are from Cochiti Sia is noted for the excellence of its earthenware the best of which is the product of two women 555 Ti mu Cochiti This Cochiti girl married a Sia man and the photograph was made at her adopted home 556 Aiyowitsa Cochiti Carolina Quintana the most mentally alert Indian woman met in more that twenty years of field work in connection with this series is a shining example of what Pueblo women can become with a little schooling and instruction in modern housekeeping She was mainly responsible for the compilation of Cochiti relationship terms given in Volume XVI 557 Lucero Santo Domingo Photographing a native of Santo Domingo is comparable to hunting big game with a camera This pueblo measures its contentment inversely to the extent of unavoidable contact with the hated white race A guard is detailed to watch the Catholic priest when he visits the village and the Government has pursued the wise policy of detailing Indian teachers to the local school The Santo Domingans long resisted the gratuitous digging of wells to be equipped with windmills continue to deny their sick children the services of the Government physician and resist the activities of census enumerators There is no doubt that the death sentence would be past on any individual found guilty of revealing native practices and if the priestly authorities learned that Lucero sold his likeness to a white man he doubtless had an unpleasant half hour 558 Kyello Santo Domingo 559 On a Sia housetop 560 Sia buffalo mask 561 Shuati Sia 562 Sia street scene Sia is situated on the north bank of Rio Jemez a few miles below Jemez pueblo Ancient Sia having participated in the revolt of 1680 was completely destroyed and a large number of its inhabitants were killed by Governor Domingo de Cruzate in 1689 The pueblo was rebuilt probably on nearly the same site and during the remaining years of this troubled period Sia remained actively friendly with the Spaniards Once a populous centre it housed only one hundred and fifty four persons in 1924 563 Sia buffalo mask 564 Acoma belfry With the possible exception of Sia Acoma possesses the oldest church among the pueblos Its bell is dated 1710 but the massive structure may have been erected as early as 1699 See Volume XVI pages 170 171 565 Feast day at Acoma Franciscan missionaries early in the seventeenth century introduced certain public Christian rites among the Pueblos which ever since have been performed with an intermingling of native ceremonial practices especially on the days of the saints of whose protection the villages were respectively assigned The day of San Estevan patron saint of Acoma is September second 566 Acoma from the south The large building in the centre is the church and the walls of the cemetery are visible at its right In the distance is the vague outline of Mount Taylor 567 Old trail at Acoma This is doubtless the trail built under the supervision of Fray Juan Ramirez who established himself at Acoma in 1629 and subsequently built a church and a trail which horses could ascend 568 Acoma water carriers 569 At the gateway Acoma 570 Acoma Roadway 571 At the old well of Acoma 572 An Acoma Woman 573 Acoma Water Girls 574 Paguate Paguate is the oldest and largest of ten villages subsidiary to Laguna the patent pueblo of this group It appears to have been founded about the middle of the eighteenth century Laguna itself dates from 1699 The two story structure at the right one of the two oldest buildings at Paguate was a watchtower erected for the defense of the farming population from the roving Navaho who disputed possession of this locality 575 Laguna architecture 576 Replastering a Paguate house 577 Laguna watchtower The Navaho caused the people of Laguna considerable trouble up to the middle of the nineteenth century The latter probably gave a good account of themselves for they were sufficiently warlike to furnish a band of volunteer scouts in the campaign against the Apache band under Geronimo for which service they or their surviving relatives were voted substantial pensions by Congress in 1924 578 Paguate entrance 579 Paguate
