and 740 under the Bella Coola agency British Columbia DRESS Both sexes wore a cedar bark or fur robe with one or both shoulders covered Men used no other garment and frequently not even this Women had also a narrow knee length apron of cedar bark fringe or goat hair cords Water proof capes and hats were made of bark Moccasins were rare Men wore the hair thrown back from the forehead and hanging down the back and women arranged it in two braids Ear pendants and nose rings of abalone shell were used by those who could afford them DWELLINGS The Kwakiutl house is constructed of cedar boards on a framework of heavy logs The ridge extends from front to back the roof boards run from ridge to eaves and the wall boards are perpendicular Until the middle of the nineteenth century the largest houses were about thirty feet square six or seven feet high at the eaves and nine at the ridge A summer house to be occupied for a considerable time is made by transferring roof and walls to the frame that stands ready Temporary huts are made of mats and poles PRIMITIVE FOODS Dried and smoked salmon and halibut clover roots Trifolium fimbriatum silverweed roots Potentilla anserina salalberries mixed with elderberries purple laver Porphyra miniata and oulachon oil Thaleichthys pacificus are the staple foods See list in the Vocabulary pages 332 333 ARTS AND INDUSTRIES Woodworking is a distinctive industry the product being cedar boards canoes water tight chests feasting dishes spoons masks and numerous smaller devices The principal industrial occupation of women is the weaving of robes baskets and mats from cedar bark Fishing and hunting implements are numerous and oftentimes ingenious GAMES Games of chance were comparatively few the most common being an unusual form of the hand game and a play in which were used forty painted rods divided into four suits Far more numerous were athletic games involving skill or endurance Such were the contests of shooting or throwing at a mark wrestling the tug of war a form of football and battledore and shuttlecock POLITICAL AND SOCIAL ORGANIZATION Kwakiutl society consists of nobility common people and alien slaves Descent is reckoned in the paternal line In each gens is a definite number of seats which closely correspond to the hereditary peerages of civilized society in that they were constituted in ancient times and that to each pertain certain names crests special ceremonial privileges and territorial rights Succession is strictly hereditary Ancestor legends uniformly indicate that the unit of primitive society in this region was a patriarchal family or village community all members of which were supposedly descendants of one man In time two or more groups coalesced and formed a tribe each component part becoming an exogamic gens In some cases tribes combined the units becoming what we term septs or sub tribes each of which retained its system of gentes The noble class are all powerful Relative rank is firmly established yet there is little that can be called political authority or governmental functions The subservience of the lower class is rather that of a servant than of a subject MARRIAGE Much ceremony attends a wedding of the nobility Each tribe and in some cases each gens has certain customs peculiar to itself but the general procedure is that the bridegroom s clansmen carry to the bride s home a quantity of goods with which they purchase her and the bride s clansmen unite in making up the first payment of the dowry Subsequent payments to the bridegroom are frequent Separation at any time is optional with either partner RELIGION AND CEREMONIES The Kwakiutl have no conception of a personified supreme power They believe in many spirits some inhabiting animal bodies others purely imaginarywhich can and do impart supernatural power to men who obtain their pity by austere bodily purification The principal ceremony is a series of quasi religious performances during about four months of the winter The ceremony is controlled by a fraternity of men women and children and the active dancers are divided among a large number of degrees The various performances consist of the dramatization of myths the personation of mythic creatures and the practice of legerdemain The most important dancer is the hamatsa who is supposed to swallow human flesh in personating the man eating spirit Pahpaqalan6hsiwi MORTUARY CUSTOMS The body with knees drawn up to chin is put into a box which is deposited in a tree a cave a canoe or a grave house with the head of the corpse to the west At

tail of the deer the tail of the snake the feet of the toad and four black chitons And she laid four clam shells beside the fire and with the tongs she picked up the tail of the deer and put it on her fire And when it began to burn the hair of it then she put the burnt hair of it into one of the clam shells and then she passed it four times up and down the tail of the deer along the back of Toqais as she sat And also she said four times May this do this to you And when she finished then she threw it on her fire and she did this with every one of the other things and when she had burned all into charcoal then she poured some water on the burnt tail of the deer and gave it for a drink to Toqai s And she poured water on the burnt ends of the digger legs of the octopus and gave it to T6qais And she took the silver perch oil and poured very little of it on the burnt tail of the snake and the same thing to the burnt feet of the toad And she stirred the powder into paste and rubbed it on the belly of Tqais first the snake and next the toad And when she finished then she took the water and she poured it on the burnt chitons and stirred it so that it was watery and when the birth pains came very often then the old woman took the chiton water and gave a drink of it to Toqais and when she Toqais drank it all then she the old woman waited to see what would happen And when the childbirth pains came close together for the child to be born then she pulled up her skirt she the old woman and stretched her legs on the floor as she sat down and she put cedar bark fibre between her knees

strained for the child to come she T6qais then blew the old woman on each side of the neck of T6qais And when the child was delivered but the afterbirth did not come quickly then she placed a small dish in front of T6qais and put a finger down her throat and when she T6qais vomited then came the afterbirth And now they called in Wakitis and when he came they took a knife and a twisted into thread piece of cotton and that is what they tied on the navel cord of the child And when they finished then they cut it off and they poured water into the bath dish and the old woman put into it her left foot and on the foot she set the child holding it with her left hand and washing it with her right And when she finished she wiped his body with soft cedar bark and she put a little red paint into his mouth to move his bowels for the bad stuff to come out of the stomach of the child And then she put around him an old blanket and now his name was Tsahes for he was born at Tsahes Fort Rupert village And now the afterbirth of the child when it had been kept four days in the house then Wakitis took a piece of yew and sharpened one end And four finger breadths was the length of it Then in the evening he took the twisted into thread sinew of a black bear and the afterbirth and he pushed the point of the yew wood into the hollow end of the afterbirth where it was cut off the navel cord And when now the length of three finger breadths went into it then he wrapped the twisted into thread sinew tightly about the part that contained the end of the stick and he rolled an old mat round it And late at night when all were asleep the people in the village then he himself he Wikitis took a clam digging stick and the bundle containing the afterbirth and he dug a hole where people all the time walked by all the men And now he wished only for the bundle of old mat to fit into the hole he dug Then he put it in the hole and now he wished only for it to be one span below the level of the ground Then he covered it with earth and when it was all levelled down the dirt then he poured a pail of water over it that it might not show that the dirt had been disturbed And when he finished then he came home to his house And if a father wished his child to understand the different cries of the raven then he put the afterbirth on the beach and when it was all eaten by ravens then the afterbirth owner the child when he was a man understood all the crying of the raven And this was a great thing for the first men for it was he the raven that brought the news of warriors coming to make a war against them And when any one saw ravens fighting and croaking in the air he immediately asked one who understood the raven And these are the different cries of the raven This I learned

        "http://memory.loc.gov/award/iencurt/cp10/cp10037v.jpg": "North American Indian List of Large Plates Supplementing Volume Ten 329 Painting a hat Nakoaktok The painter is clad in a short seamless cedar bark cape which is worn for protection from rain That she is a woman of wealth and rank is shown by the abalone shell nose ornament and the gold bracelets no less than by her possession of a chief s hat These waterproof hats of a form borrowed from the Haida are made of closely woven shreds of fibrous spruce roots and are ornamented with one of the owner s crests a highly conventionalized painting of some animal or mythological being 330 Carved posts at Alert Bay These two heraldic columns at the Nimkish village Yilis on Cormorant island represent the owner s paternal crest an eagle and his maternal crest a grizzly bear crushing the head of a rival chief On the subject of crests and totem poles see Volume X page 140 and illustrations facing pages 8 10 18 20 24 26 34 138 140 174 176 and folio plates 341 350 353 331 Qa hila Koprino This young chief of an almost extinct tribe resident on Quatsino sound near the northwestern end of Vancouver island is wearing one of the nose ornaments formerly common among Kwakiutl nobility The dentalium shells of which they consisted were obtained in vast numbers in certain waters of the sound See Volume X page 44 332 Mowakiu Tsawatenok The Tsawatenok are an inland river tribe depending on the sea for their sustenance much less than do most Kwakiutl tribes and to an equal degree devoting more time to hunting and trapping in the mountains Their territory lies along Kingcome river at the head of the long mainland indentation known as Kingcome inlet 333 Hamasaka in Tlu wulahu costume with speaker s staff Qagyuhl The principal chief of the Qagyuhl is depicted in a button blanket which is simply a woolen blanket ornamented with hundreds of large mother of pearl buttons cedar bark neck ring and cedar bark head band His right hand grasps a shaman s rattle and his left the carved staff which as a kind of emblem of office a man always holds when making a speech The button designs along the edge of the blanket represent coppers see page 144 The tlu wulahu ceremony is described on page 243 of Volume X 334 Nakoaktok chief s daughter When the head chief of the Nakoaktok holds a potlatch a ceremonial distribution of property to all the people his eldest daughter is thus enthroned symbolically supported on the heads of her slaves 335 Siwit Awaitlala 336 Kotsuis and Hohhuq Nakoaktok These two masked performers in the winter dance represent huge mythical birds Kotsuis the Nakoaktok equivalent of the Qagyuhl Kaloqutsuis and Hohhuq are servitors in the house of the man eating monster Pahpaqalanohsiwi See page 160 The mandibles of these tremendous wooden masks are controlled by strings 337 Coming for the bride In the bow qunhulahl a masked man personating the thunderbird dances with characteristic gestures as the canoe approaches the bride s village 338 Chief s party Qagyuhl 339 On the beach Nakoaktok This high born clam digger is wearing aboriginal costume consisting of a cedar bark blanket used as a robe a cedar bark rain cape a spruce root chief s hat and woollen ankle bands 340 In Kwakiutl waters In a characteristic setting is shown a fleet of the beautifully modelled Kwakiutl canoes manned by crews in aboriginal dress 341 Koskimo house post The huge grotesquely carved interior supporting columns are the most striking feature of Kwakiutl houses The figures perpetuate the memory of incidents in the legendary history of the family frequently representing a tutelary spirit of the founder 342 Gathering abalones Nakoaktok 343 Kwakiutl house frame The two long beams in the middle are twin ridge timbers which are supported in the rear as in the front by a transverse beam resting on two uprights At the extreme right and left are the eaves timbers The longitudinal and circular flutes of the columns are laboriously produced by means of a small hand adze of primitive form This frame is at the village Memkumlis Another view is given in the illustration facing page 36 Kwakiutl houses are discussed on page 6 344 Wedding party Qagyuhl After the wedding ceremony at the bride s village the party returns to the husband s home The newly married pair stand on a painted bride s seat in the stern of the canoe and the bridegroom s sister or other relative dances on a platform in the bow while the men sing and rhythmically thump the canoes with the handles of their paddles 345 Quatsino Sound 346 Yakotlus Quatsino profile In physique and intelligence the Quatsino seem inferior to the other Kwakiutl tribes This plate illustrates the artificial deformation of the head which formerly was quite general on the North Pacific coast The process is described in Volume X page 52 347 Yakotlus Quatsino 348 Group of winter dancers Qagyuhl 349 Fire drill Koskimo 350 Nimkish village at Alert Bay The figure at the bottom of the column in the foreground with the painting on the front of the house represents a raven When a feast or a dance is to be held in this house the guests enter through the raven s beak the lower mandible of which swings up and down on a pivot When a guest steps beyond the pivot his weight caused the beak to clap shut and thus the mythic raven symbolically swallows the tribesman one by one A view from the other end of this street is shown in the illustration facing page 8 Volume X 351 Masked dancers in canoes Qagyhl A Visitors approaching a village where the winter dance is in progress sometimes array themselves in their ceremonial costumes and dance while the canoes slowly move shoreward From left to right the dancers represent respectively Wasp Thunderbird and Grizzly bear 352 Rounding into port Qagyhl The primitive Kwakiutl sail for canvas was a sheet of cedar bark matting and on catamarans a large square section of thin boards was propped up against the wind Canvas is now used The painting on the canoe at the left represents sisiutl the mythical double headed serpent The carved figure heads of the middle canoe and the one on the right are respectively an eagle and a bear The bear canoe is further embellished with highly conventionalized paintings of the head flipper and tail of a whale 353 Qagyuhl village at Fort Rupert This village of Tsahes was founded in 1849 when the tribe abandoned Kalokwis on Turnour island in order to be near the Hudson s Bay Company post which was then established at Fort Rupert on Vancouver island The heraldic column in the foreground commemorates the legendary history of a Tsimshian family Its presence in the Kwakiutl settlement is due to the following circumstances A party of Seattle men cruising in Alaska innocently removed a totem pole from what they supposed was an abandoned village and placed it in a public square of their city In reality the inhabitants of the Alaskan village were only temporarily absent and when they returned and learned of the spoliation there was a many voiced protest the echoes of which finally reached even Fort Rupert Here was living a prominent member of the wronged family the aged Tsimshian widow of a former employee of the Hudson s Bay Company In order to wipe out the stain in the family name she had a local carver produce a totem pole according to her description of the lost one and cause it to be erected at the house of her eldest son s eldest son 354 Koskimo woman The head is a good illustration of the extremes to which the Quatsino Sound tribes carried the practice of artificially lengthening the skulls of their infants 355 Dancing to restore an eclipsed moon Qagyuhl It is thought that an eclipse is the result of an attempt of some creature in the sky to swallow the luminary In order to compel the monster to disgorge it the people dance round a smoldering fire of old clothing and hair the stench of which rising to his nostrils is expected to cause him to sneeze and disgorge the moon 356 Sailing Qagyuhl The canoe in the foreground fifty five feet in length overall is probably the largest native craft now in existence on the North Pacific coast and it is doubtful if any canoe of greater size was ever made in this region 357 Wedding guests 358 Masked dancers Qagyuhl The plate shows a group of masked and costumed performers in the winter ceremony The chief who is holding the dance stands at the left grasping a speaker s staff and wearing cedar bark neck ring and head band and a few of the spectators are visible at the right At the extreme left is seen a part of the painted mawihl through which the dancers emerge from the secret room and in the centre between the carved house posts is the Awaitlala hams pek showing three of the five mouths through which the hamatsa wriggle from the top to the bottom of the column See page 175 and footnote 359 Passing a dreaded point Precipitous cliffs such as this are especially feared in rough weather and the steersman usually supplicates the genius loci under the title of Numas old man 360 Inland waterway 361 Bridal group The bride stands in the middle between two dancers hired for the occasion Her father is at the left and the bridegroom s father at the right behind a man who presides over the box drum 362 Masked dancers in canoes Qagyuhl B 363 Tsulniti Koskimo 364 Chief s daughter Nakoaktok",
