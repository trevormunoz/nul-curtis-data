into the life of the Indian that this picture of the grim old warrior invoking the Mysteries is most characteristic The subject of the illustration is Slow Bull whose biography is given in Volume III page 189 77 Ogalala war party Here is depicted a group of Sioux warriors as they appeared in the days of intertribal warfare carefully making their way down a hillside in the vicinity of the enemy s camp Many hold in their hands instead of weapons mere sticks adorned with eagle feathers or scalps the so called coup sticks desiring to win honor by striking a harmless blow therewith as well as to inflict injury with arrow and bullet 78 Two Strike A biographical sketch of this Brule chief appears in Volume II page 190 79 Sioux chiefs Very often two or three men would form themselves into a war party and ride away to be gone weeks or months Sometimes they returned with scalps or horses or women and again the war party whether large or small met defeat and none survived to bring back to anxious wives and children the story of the disaster 80 Oasis in the Bad Lands Curtis This picture was made in the heart of the Bad Lands of South Dakota The subject is the sub chief Red Hawk a sketch of whose life is given on page 188 of Volume III 81 Jack Red Cloud The subject of this portrait is the son of the Ogalala chief Red Cloud See No 103 82 Hollow Horn Bear The life of this Brule Sioux is briefly treated in Volume III page 186 83 Sun dancer As they dance the performers never leave the spot on which they stand the movement consisting in a slight upward spring from the toes and ball of the foot legs and body are rigid Always the right palm is extended to the yellow glaring sun and their eyes are fixed on its lower rim The dancer concentrates his mind his very self upon the one thing that he desires whether it be the acquirement of powerful medicine or only success in the next conflict with the enemy Volume III pages 95 96 84 Slow Bull Ogalala A biographical sketch of this subject is found on page 189 of Volume III 85 Brule war party This rhythmic picture shows a party of Brule Sioux re enacting a raid against the enemy 86 Gray day in the Bad Lands A cold cheerless day when the party of Sioux wrapped closely in their blankets rode in stolid silence 87 High Hawk The subject is shown in all the finery of a warrior dressed for a gala occasion scalp shirt leggings moccasins and pipe bag all embroidered with porcupine quills eagle feather war bonnet and stone headed war club from the handle of which dangles a scalp High Hawk is prominent among the Brules mainly because he is now their leading historical authority being much in demand to determine the dates of events important to his fellow tribesmen His calendar or winter count is explained and in part reproduced in Volume III pages 159 182 88 Prairie chief This picture was made on the Pine Ridge reservation in South Dakota at a time when the Indians were assembled in a large encampment reliving the days of old 89 Little Hawk This portrait exhibits the typical Brule physiognomy 90 Hukalowapi ceremony The subject of this picture is Saliva an Ogalala Sioux a priest of the Hukalowapi ceremony which is fully described in Volume III pages 71 87 91 Prayer to the Mystery In supplication the pipe was always offered to the Mystery by holding it aloft At the feet of the worshipper lies a buffalo skull symbolic of the spirit of the animal upon which the Indians were so dependent The subject of the picture is Picket Pin an Ogalala Sioux 92 Fast Elk A brief sketch of this Ogalala appears on page 184 of Volume III 93 Sioux camp It was customary for a war party to ride in circles about the tipi of their chief before starting on a raid into the country of the enemy 94 Ogalala woman A face so strong that it is almost masculine showing strikingly how slight may be the difference between the male and female physiognomy in some primitive people 95 In the land of the Sioux This picture illustrates the general character of the Sioux country The broad rolling prairie is broken by low hills while here and there lie pools of stagnant water in old buffalo wallows The subjects of the pictures are Red Hawk Crazy Thunder and Holy Skin three Ogalala who accompanied the author on a trip into the Bad Lands 96 Ogalala girls Description by Edward S Curtis As a rule the women of the plains tribes are natural horsewomen and their skill in riding is scarcely exceeded by that of the men As mere infants they are tied upon the backs of trusty animals and thus become accustomed to the long days of journeying 97 Sioux girl A young Sioux woman in a dress made entirely of deerskin embroidered with beads and porcupine quills 98 Planning a raid The Indians in their striking and characteristic costumes unconsciously form themselves into most picturesque groups This shows a party of Ogalala Sioux on a hill overlooking the valley of Wounded Knee creek on the Pine Ridge reservation in South Dakota 99 Morning attack The favorite moment for attack was just at dawn when the enemy was presumably unprepared to offer quick resistance 100 Heavy load Sioux Summer and winter the Sioux women performed the heavy work of the camp and what was seemingly drudgery was to her part of the pleasure of life 101 Black Eagle Assiniboin The life of Black Eagle is briefly treated in Volume III page 182 102 Mosquito Hawk A biographical sketch of this subject is found in Volume 111 page 187 103 Red Cloud Ogalala A biographical sketch of this well known chief and celebrated warrior is given n page 187 of Volume III 104 Crazy Thunder Ogalala A splendid specimen of the Teton Sioux 105 Wood gatherer Sioux Fuel for cooking and for warming the tipi was gathered and carried by the women as a part of their domestic work 106 Winter camp Sioux With the coming of winter the plains tribes pitched their camps in forested valleys where they not only were protected from the fierce winds of the plains but had an ample supply of fuel at hand 107 Assiniboin camp In making their camps the Indians often chose more picturesque spots 108 American Horse Ogalala This subject is one of the four chiefs whose election is described in Volume III page 16 He died in December 1908 109 Invocation Sioux Scattered throughout the Indian country are found spots that are virtually shrines These are often boulders or other rocks which through some chance have been invested with mythic significance and to them priest and war leaders repair to invoke the aid of the supernatural powers The half buried bowlder on which the suppliant stands is accredited with the power of revealing to the warrior the foreordained result of his projected raid Its surface bears what the Indians call the imprint of human feet and it is owing to this peculiarity that it became a shrine About it the soil is almost completely worn away by the generations of suppliants who have journeyed hither for divine revelation 110 Mountain sheep hunter Sioux Mountain sheep grazing in the most inaccessible parts of the Bad Lands were sought only by the most ambitious hunters 119 In the Bad Lands This striking picture was made at Sheep Mountain
