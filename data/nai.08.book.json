better known than that of any other Northwestern Indian To him popular opinion has given the credit of conducting a remarkable strategic movement from Idaho to northern Montana in the flight of the Nez Perces in 1877 To what extent this is a misconception has been demonstrated in the historical effort to retain what was rightly their own makes an unparalleled story in the annals of the Indian s resistance to the greed of the whites That they made this final effort is not surprising Indeed it is remarkable that so few tribes rose in a last struggle against such dishonored and relentless objection 257 Yellow Bull Nez Perce As a member of the family which more than once was responsible for precipitating the Nez Perce outbreak of 1877 Yellow Bull proved a source of much valuable

wrappings of his hair braids indicates the extent to which the Nez Perces were influenced by the Indians of the prairies whom they met in their annual pilgrimage to the buffalo country 258 Typical Nez Perce This portrait presents a splendid type of the Nez Perce man 259 Raven Blanket Nez Perce 260 Night scout Nez Perce 261 Watching for the signal Nez Perce 262 Nez Perce warrior 263 Nez Perce brave 264 Lawyer Nez Perce The original of this portrait is a member of the family of that Lawyer who played a prominent part in the Nez Perce affairs in the years following the treaty of 1855 265 Black Eagle Nez Perce 266 Nez Perce babe 267 Piopio maksmaks Wallawalla Piopio maksmaks quoted in Volume VIII pages 20 21 is the son of the Piopio maksmaks who as principal chief of the Wallawalla negotiated a treaty with Governor Isaac I Stevens in the Wallawalla valley in 1855 The father was killed while a captive of the Oregon volunteers and the son thereafter lived permanently among the Nez Perces having married a woman of that tribe Piopio maksmaks possesses as unusually strong face and his remarkably piercing eye betokens a man possessing the courage characteristic of his family and tribe 268 Piopio maksmaks profile Wallawalla 269 Umatilla maid Two distinct cultural areas are represented in the costume of this damsel The familiar beadworked deerskin dress is an acquisition from the plains culture while the basketry hat and the shell bead necklace hail from the pacific slope Note the skin of the deer s tail fastened in front at the collar as an aid in removing the garment 270 Innocence Umatilla Few aspects of Indian life are more interesting to the casual visitor than the demeanor of the children with the coy bashfulness their mischievous sparkling eyes their doubtful hesitating just the other side of friendship 271 War chief Nez Perce 272 Cayuse warrior 273 Holiday trappings Cayuse Wealthy members of the tribes living on the Umatilla reservation in Oregon spare no expense in bedecking themselves and their mounts on gala occasions The articles of adornment are usually of deerskin or of commercial blankets on which designs are worked in beads 274 Fisherman Wishham Among the middle course of the Columbia at places where the abruptness of the shore and the up stream set of an eddy make such method possible salmon were taken and still are taken by means of a long hauled dip net At favorable seasons a man will in a few hours secure several hundred salmon as many as the matrons and girls of his household can care for in a day 275 Dip netting in pools Wishham In the quiet pools along the rocky shore the salmon sometimes lie resting from their long journey up stream The experienced fisherman knows these spots and by a deft movement of his net he takes toll from each one 276 Spearing salmon Wishham The nature of the shore and the height of the water level sometimes combine to make dip netting impossible Recourse is then had to the double pointed spear the socketed barbs of which are connected to the shaft by strong cords so that when a fish is struck and its struggles detach the barbs from the prongs it is held by a hook and line 277 Fish carrier Wishham From the fishing station the salmon are carried to the house distant perhaps a quarter of a mile or more in an open mesh bag ihlkabenih borne on the back and supported by means of a tump line passing across the forehead 278 Wishham girl The subject is clothed in a heavily beaded deerskin dress of the plains type The throat is encircled by strands of shell beads of native manufacture heirlooms which were obtained by the original Wishham possessor from the Pacific slope Pendant on the breast are strands of larger beads of the same kind as well as of various kinds brought into the country by the traders of the Hudson s Bay Company An indispensable ornament of the well born person was the dentalium shell thrust through a perforation in the nasal septum occasionally as in this case two such shells were connected by means of a bit of wood pushed into the hollow bases Tied to the hair at each side of the face see the following plate is another dentalium shell ornament which is in reality an ear pendant transferred from the lobe of the ear where its weight would be inconvenient to the hair The head dress consists of shells shell beads commercial beads and Chinese coins The coins made their appearance in the Columbia River region at a comparatively early date This form of head dress was worn on special occasions by girls between the age of puberty and their marriage 279 Wishham girl profile 280 Wishham woman 281 Wishham bride 282 Hlalakum Wishham 283 Kashhila Wishham This sturdy young fellow has little of the appearance of the Chinookan In feature and in costume he recalls the plains Indian 284 Wishham maid Clad in her deerskin dress of the plains and her basketry hat of the coast the girl pauses on the grim lava rocks above the Dalles looking out across the thundering rapids perhaps observing the activities after friends in the village Wasko 285 Columbia near Wind River The Chinookan tribes of the Columbia obtained their canoes for the greater part from the coast tribes of Washington The woman in the picture is the daughter of the former Cascade chief Tamahl quoted in Volume VII pages 26 28 286 Lower Columbia The Columbia near its mouth spreads in a broad estuary between shores now low and flat and again bold and wooded The conflict between winds tides and current sometimes raises seas that threaten even power driven craft and the natives who formerly swarmed in this region were necessarily clever canoemen 287 Evening on the Columbia A spur of the Cascade mountains occupies the background 288 Middle Columbia This picture was made a few miles above the Cascades of the Columbia 289 On Klickitat River A Klickitat river flows through what was the territory of the Klickitat a bold roving gypsy like group of Shahaptian bands See Volume VII page 37 The picture which shows one of a succession of beautiful scenes near the mouth of this stream accompanies Volume VII for the reason that the land at its junction with the Columbia was formerly Chinookan territory and in fact it was never altogether given up to the Klickitat 290 On Klickitat River B 291 On Klickitat River C 292 On the beach Chinook An old Chinook woman with staff and clam basket makes her way slowly over the mud flats of the southern end of Shoalwater bay in Washington Chiih Burden Basket Catherine Hawks is one of a very few survivors of the populous tribe that formerly occupied that part of the state of Washington lying between the middle of Shoalwater bay and the Columbia",
