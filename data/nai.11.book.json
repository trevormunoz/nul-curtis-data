Wolf came and carried the body away When the old man saw the Wolf he knocked on the side of the house and said Come my sons and see There is a Wolf coming for your young brother The nine came out and saw the Wolf throw the body on his back and disappear in the forest Now the youth was conscious and he breathed as lightly as possible for whenever the Wolf felt his breathing he threw the body off

chief invited all the people and when all were inside he called for the cutter Suddenly the young man exclaimed Woof and sat up Surprised with their wolf skins off they found themselves in the power of the young man So the chief gave him a seat in the back of the house and the Raven was compelled to disgorge the eye which was then restored to its place After offering many things to him they at last gave him what he really desired the death dealing stone club and told him how to use it by simply exhibiting it to whatever person he wished to destroy So the youth returned home and with the club he killed many whales and geese Then he called the ten tribes septs which had fought his people Some were fearful of coming because they thought he might have received the death dealer but the

dislodged the key stick and the bent wood springing back held it fast to the barb The salmon trap consisted of a weir obstructing a stream in such a way that the water poured over it in a single place At this point a large wicker box was placed below the weir and salmon that failed to leap the fall tumbled back into the trap Before the advent of steel tools large canoes were commonly twenty five to thirty feet long and were made from logs seven spans forty inches thick To fell such a tree with stone and bone implements was the work of four days Afterward the length increased to seven or eight fathoms thirty five to forty feet The largest one known to the Haida was the Chief Canoe at Massett It is said to have been fifteen fathoms seventy five feet long and about seven feet beam GAMES The Haida had two gambling games sin in which a player guessed which of two bunches of bark contained a marked rod and lahal the hand game Other games were contests of athletic skill or were designed for amusement POLITICAL AND SOCIAL ORGANIZATION Originally each village was the home of a single clan but within historical times there were in many cases several clans living together The very large number of clans existing among the Haida composed two phratries the Raven and the Eagle Not only the clan but the phratry also was exogamic Descent is maternal When this fact is connected with the title people s mother for the village chief and with the definite statement of a tradition that the chief of a certain southern village was a woman it becomes apparent that in the not distant past the Haida woman was the actual head of the family The town chief exercised considerable authority not because he had any physical means of enforcing obedience but because by common consent his approval of every important step was necessary before the undertaking could have public sympathy In short an opponent of the chief was socially at an enormous disadvantage with his rivals The usual division of the people into nobles commoners and slaves prevailed MARRIAGE After formally obtaining the promise of the girl s family the bridegroom s party assembled in her house and delivered many boasting speeches concerning their family s greatness Then her father delivered his speech of acceptance and the girl went to sit beside the bridegroom This act consummated the marriage Generally the couple lived for a time with the wife s people before taking up their permanent abode with the other family There was no barter or exchange of tremendous marriage portions in the manner observed by the Kwakiutl RELIGION AND CEREMONIES Haida thought peopled the earth with a vast number of anthropomorphic supernatural beings many of them named but more nameless Every spot exhibiting an unusual feature such as a sharp point of rock a cranny where the tide sucks and soughs a high peak was believed to be the home of a s kil Strangely enough the Haida do not claim to have had much communion with these beings The myths tell of them but few men claim to have seen them in vigils The Haida possessed a winter ceremony which was in the control of a secret society It was borrowed in its entirety from other tribes principally from the Kwakiutl and the Tsimshian Many of the names for the dancers and all the songs are foreign The ceremony was always given by a man who was engaged in building a house or erecting a totem pole and these things could not be done without giving the ceremony MORTUARY CUSTOMS After sitting in the house facing the occupants for several days a corpse was placed in a box and carried out through the rear wall to be deposited in a mortuary hut At some later time if a chief was concerned the coffin was placed in a niche at the top or in the bottom of a mortuary post erected by his successor Relatives frequently threw food and water into the flames that the spiritual counterpart of the substance might pass to the dead in Gyatlgai where they lived in happiness WAR There were frequent periods of hostility between the southern the western and the northern Haida of Queen Charlotte islands as well as between all these and the Alaska Haida They all fought also with the Tsimshian Tlingit and Kwakiutl Some of the Haida became bold travellers and voyaged in their canoes to Victoria and Puget sound On such occasions they were almost certain to encounter enemies War was carried on for the taking of slaves heads and spoils The consent of the town chief was necessary before a war party started and he chose what he regarded as a lucky day MYTHOLOGY Haida myths are quite different from those of the more southerly tribes of this coast Most of them describe the activities of the supernaturals and usually the motive is noticeably more alien to our thought than for example in Salish and Kwakiutl mythology",

366 Shores of Nootka Sound This plate conveys an excellent impression of the character of much of the Vancouver Island coast with its rugged tide washed rocks thickly timbered lowland and lofty mountains in the distance 367 Hesquiat root digger Nootka women very commonly wore bark cape folded over the head to protect the forehead from the tump line when carrying the burden basket The proper use of the cape was to shed rain 368 Berry picker Clayoquot 369 Seaweed gatherer Seaweed of the genus Porphyra is a favorite food among all the tribes of the North Pacific coast The green membranous fronds are gathered in the spring from tidal rocks and are pressed into flat cakes and dried 370 Whale ceremonial Clayoquot Before daring to practise his dangerous art the whaler subjects himself to a long and rigorous course of ceremonial purification in order to render himself pleasing to the spirit whale He bathes frequently rubs his body vigorously with hemlock sprigs dives and imitates the movements of a whale 371 Boarding the canoe A Hesquiat berry picker in primitive garb on the bold shores of Clayoquot sound The barefoot natives make their way without difficulty over barnacle covered rocks such as these It will be noted that the canoe has been fitted with rowlocks 372 Clayoquot girl 373 Canoeing on Clayoquot Sound Two Hesquiat women are homeward bound with the product of their day s labor in gathering food and cedar bark to be used in making mats 374 Nootka method of spearing The harpoon for seals porpoises and salmon is double headed so that if the point on the main shaft glances off the other may perhaps lodge in the hunter s prey 375 Oldest man of Nootka This individual is the most primitive relic in the modernized village of Nootka Stark naked he may be seen hobbling about the beach or squatting in the sun living in thought in the golden age when the social and ceremonial customs of his people were what they had always been 376 Ceremonial bathing The subject of this plate is a female shaman of the Clayoquot tribe The ceremonial washing of shamans is much like that of whalers and other hunters consisting mainly of sitting or standing in water and rubbing the body with hemlock sprigs in order to remove all earthly taint which would offend the supernatural powers 377 Hesquiat woman 378 Clayoquot type It was men such as the possessor of this inscrutable face who in 1811 attacked the Astor trading ship Tonquin in Clayoquot sound so successfully that the only recourse of the remnant of the crew was to blow up the vessel 379 Hesquiat maiden The girl wears the cedar bark ornaments that are tied to the hair of virgins on the fifth morning of their puberty ceremony as described in Volume XI page 42 The fact that the girl who posed for this picture was the prospective mother of an illegitimate child caused considerable amusement to the native onlookers and to herself 380 Into the shadow Clayoquot A medicine woman alone is seeking a solitary place in which to perform her rites of bodily purification Most of the Indian women are no less skillful that the men in handling canoes 381 Nootka woman wearing cedar bark blanket 382 Whaler Clayoquot The spear in the subject s hand is the weapon of a warrior not of a whaler 383 Bark gatherer These people still use large quantities of yellow cedar bark in the manufacture of mats and formerly this material furnished them their clothing also The Hesquiat woman in the picture has a bulky pack of bark on her back and in her hand is a steel bladed adz of the primitive type 384 Nootka woman 385 Makah maiden 386 At Nootka The canoe is floating on the waters of Boston cove where in 1803 the trading ship Boston was taken and burned by the Mooachaht Indians and the entire crew killed except John Jewitt and John Thompson who were held as slaves by the chief for three years Jewitt s brief account of his captivity is one of our most interesting records of life among the Indians 387 Waiting for the canoe As evening approaches two women with clam baskets and digging sticks gaze across the water anxiously awaiting the canoe that is to come and convey them home 388 Haiyahl Nootka A Nootka woman in profile with a shell nose ring and fur edged bark blanket 389 Shores of Nootka Sound This plate conveys an excellent impression of the character of much of the Vancouver Island coast with its rugged tide washed rocks thickly timbered lowland and lofty mountains in the distance 390 Nootka man It is commonly believed that the facial hair of many North Coast natives is proof of intermingled Caucasian blood but that such is not the case is conclusively proved by the statement of Captain Cook who in 1778 observed that some of them and particularly the old men have not only considerable beards all over the chin but whiskers and mustachios 391 On the west coast of Vancouver Island Lacking hats to protect their heads from the sun women sometimes make use of wreaths of foliage 392 Fish spearing Clayoquot The fisherman is taking flounders and other flatfish which lie half covered in the sand At certain seasons when the water is turbid by reason of the presence of excessive marine growth objects on the bottom of a quiet bay can be discerned at a surprising depth It is frequently assumed that the prows of North Coast canoes are carved in imitation of a dog s head but the natives deny any intentional resemblance The notch in the top of the prow dividing it into two sections suggestive of an animal s ears is simply a rest for the shaft of a spear or harpoon 393 Return of halibut fishers Huge quantities of halibut are taken by the Makah at Cape Flattery and the flesh is sliced thin and dried for storage 394 Whaler 395 Whaler Makah Note the great size of the harpoon shaft Indian whalers implanted the harpoon point by thrusting not by hurling the weapon 396 Captured whale A small humpback whale Megapter lies partially butchered on the beach at Neah Bay 397 Haida chief s tomb at Yan The remains of the chief rest in a niche cut into the top of the transverse beam This tomb is of unusual form and must have been erected at enormous cost to the dead man s family 398 Haida of Massett The head dress is a dancing hat and consists of a carved wooden mask surmounted by numerous sea lion bristles and with many pendent strips of ermine skin 399 Haida of Kung 400 Haida slate carvings Some of the Haida men are remarkably skilled in carving miniature totem poles out of a soft black slate A column such as those here reproduced simply recounts a myth",
