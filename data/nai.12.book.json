Loitering at the spring A group of Walpi and Hano girls in holiday attire The background is a typical bit of Southwestern desert 401 Buffalo dance at Hano The Buffalo dance at the Upper Rio Grande pueblos was lately introduced among the Hopi who attach no religious significance to it 402 Tewa girl An excellent feminine type of these early immigrants from the Rio Grande The arrangement of her hair suggests that she is unmarried 403 Hopi mother 404 Antelopes and snakes at Oraibi The Antelope fraternity at the right and the Snake fraternity facing them at the left engage in singing prior to handling the reptiles in the Snake dance At the extreme right is the kisi a cottonwood booth in which sits the custodian of the snake jars ready to hand out the reptiles one by one to the dancers 405 Watching the dancers A group of girls on the topmost roof of Walpi looking down into the plaza 406 Hopi girl Soft regular features are characteristic of Hopi young women and no small part of a mother s time is used to be devoted to dressing the hair of her unmarried daughters The aboriginal style is rapidly being abandoned and the native one piece dress here illustrated is seldom seen even at the less advanced of the Hopi 407 Evening in Hopi land 408 Honovi Walpi snake priest with Totokya Day painting This plate depicts the accoutrement of a Snake dancer on the day of the Antelope dance see Volume XII pages 146 149 The right hand grasps a pair of eagle feathers the snake whip and the left a bag of ceremonial meal Honovi was one of the author s principal informants 409 On the housetop A typical village scene illustrating many features of pueblo architecture At the extreme left is the entrance of an underground kiva with the tips of the ladder projecting In the central foreground is a baking room where piki is prepared and to the left is an outdoor oven for baking loaf bread 410 Walpi Picturesque Walpi perched on the point of a rocky island in a sea of sand is an irregular rambling community house built without design added to in haphazard fashion as need arose yet it constitutes a perfectly satisfying artistic whole 411 Hopi woman 412 Hopi maiden 413 Counting the record A series of marks cut into the rock at Middle mesa records the losses inflicted on the marauding enemies in a former generation 414 Chaiwa Tewa 415 Chaiwa Tewa profile 416 At the trysting place 417 East side of Walpi Few illustrations of Hopi architecture show as much regularity as this view of a Walpi street 418 Snake priest The white markings typifying the antelope indicate that the subject is accoutred for the semi final day of the Snake dance when the public performance consists of the dance and the ceremonial race of the Antelope fraternity 419 Potter mixing clay This woman so aged that her shrivelled skin hangs in folds still finds pleasure in creating artistic and utilitarian pieces of pottery 420 Hopi man In this physiognomy we read the dominant traits of Hopi character The eyes speak of wariness if not downright distrust The mouth shows great possibilities of unyielding stubbornness Yet somewhere in this face lurks an expression of masked warmheartedness and humanity 421 Hopi architecture The house walls are about eighteen inches thick and consist of fragments of sandstone shaped by fracture but undressed and bound together with mud plaster The upper levels of the terraced buildings are reached by ladders and by stone steps 422 Snake dancers entering the plaza At the right stand the Antelopes in front of the booth containing the snake jars The Snakes enter the plaza encircle it four times with military tread and then after a series of songs remarkable for their irresistible movement they proceed to dance with the reptiles 423 Primitive style of hairdressing The arrangement imitates the squash blossom and indicates virginity Within the last decade it has become rare except on ceremonial occasions 424 Walpi man 425 Mishongnovi A comprehensive view of this interesting Middle Mesa pueblo On an eminence in the middle background is Shipaulovi and at the right several miles distant is Shongopavi on another tongue of the mesa 426 Potter Every visitor at East mesa knows Nampeyo the potter of Hano whose creations excel those of any rival Stranger wander into her house welcome though unbidden but Nampeyo only works and smiles In the plate her paint stone occupies the central foreground 427 East mesa girls 428 Modified style of hairdressing 429 Walpi snake priest This subject is Koyawaima gray dawn walking who has been chief of the fraternity since 1899 430 Snake dancer in costume 431 Flute dancers at Tureva Spring The Flute dance is a religious ceremony concerned with bringing rain It represents the legendary arrival of the Flute people in the Hopi country their friendly encounter with the clans already there and the rain making rites subsequently performed by them for the common good The episode here represented was photographed at Middle mesa The individual seated near the right end is an albino not a white man 432 Piki maker Piki is cornbread baked in colored sheets of paper like thinness The batter is spread on the baking stone with the bare hand and the quickly baked sheet is folded and laid on the basket at the baker s left 433 Depositing a prayer stick Round painted sticks with feathers attached by cotton cords are deposited in various places particularly in springs and at shrines in supplication to the spirits associated with the locality 434 Tewa girl An excellent feminine type of these early immigrants from the Rio Grande The arrangement of her hair suggests that she is unmarried 435 Water carriers",
