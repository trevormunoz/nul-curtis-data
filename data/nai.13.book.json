of yellowed porcupine quills either pendent or in the lobe of the ear itself Red paint was smeared on the face in various designs for special occasions and warriors used a white earth and soot on the

running from ridge to ea es The walls were of slabs sticks and bark banked up with earth from the excavation The doorway at the middle of one end was less than the height of a man and was covered with

was at the edge of the pit between the bases of two rafters and at the back leading to the open air was a small tunnel which served to create a draft when the fire was started In addition to the

Klamath woman 437 Sam Ewing Yurok 438 Karok baskets The basketry of the Karok does not differ from that of the Hupa and the Yurok The process is always twining and the usual materials are hazel rod for the warp roots of the digger or the yellow pine for the weft and Xerophyllum grass for white overlay bark of the maidenhair fern for black and fibres from the stem of Woodwardia fern dyed in alder bark juice in the mouth of the workwoman for red Represented in the plate are the receptacle for the storage of seeds and nuts the burden basket the winnowing tray various sizes of mush baskets and food containers and the cradle basket 439 Hupa trout trap 440 Old Klamath woman 441 A Klamath The entire costume here depicted is alien to the primitive Klamath The feather head dress and fringed shirt and leggings of deerskin were adopted by this tribe within the historical period along with other phases of the Plains culture which extended its influence to the Klamath country by way of Columbia river and the plains of central Oregon 442 Hupa jumping dance costume The Jumping dance was an annual ceremony for averting pestilence The head dress worn by the dancers was a wide band of deerskin with rows of red woodpecker crests and a narrow edging of white deer hair sewn on it A deerskin robe was worn as a kilt and each performer displayed all the shells and beads he possessed or could borrow In the right hand was carried a straw stuffed cylinder with a slit like opening from end to end an object the significance of which is unknown to the modern Hupa 443 Yurok canoe on Trinity River The Yurok canoe is simply a hollowed section of a redwood log The aboriginal implements for canoe making were a stone hammer and an elk horn chisel for cutting the log and removing a number of slabs in order to reduce it to the desired thickness and an elk horn adz for finishing the surface The actual hollowing was accomplished by means of fire The craft shown in the plate is hardly an average example as to the workmanship but at best Yurok canoes are rather crude 444 Quiet waters Yurok The plate shows the ruggedness characteristic of the shores of Klamath river Eddies caused by projecting masses of rock are the spots chosen for taking salmon in dip nets both because the upstream set of the current permits the net to be held with the opening down stream and because the salmon are attracted to such pools of slack water after combatting the swift current 445 Wife of Modoc Henry Klamath 446 A Klamath type 447 Fishing from canoe Hupa Because of the dearth of redwood in their territory the Hupa purchased all their canoes from the neighboring Yurok 448 In the forest Klamath The Klamath live in a country of lakes and marshes broad meadows and forested mountains The reservation itself includes an extensive area of splendid pines 449 Klamath warrior s headdress The material used in this peaked hat is tule stems and the weaving is done by the twined process 450 Hupa mother and child 451 Hupa woman It would be difficult to find a better type of Hupa female physiognomy 452 Salmon stream A Hupa youth is waiting with poised spear for the shadowy outline of a salmon lurking in a quiet pool and gathering its strength for a dash through a tiny cascade 453 Hupa fisherman The fisherman has just made a thrust with his double pointed spear 454 Spearing salmon 455 Tolowa dancing headdress The head dress is of the type common to the Klamath River tribes a broad band of deerskin partially covered with a row of red scalps of woodpecker The massive necklace of clam shell beads indicates the wealth of the wearer or of the friend from whom he borrowed it He carries a ceremonial celt of black obsidian and a decorated bow 456 Klamath lake marshes Fairly extensive marshes occur along the shores of Klamath lake and Klamath marsh covers about a hundred square miles These areas are the resort of innumerable waterfowl which were of great importance to the aboriginal Klamath and thousands of acres were a mass of water lilies which yielded in abundance an edible seed 457 Yurok drummer The drum of deerskin stretched over a wooden frame was not aboriginal with the Yurok but was introduced in imitation of drums seen in the possession of the garrison stationed among the Hupa from 1855 to 1892 458 Klamath hunter 459 Fish weir across Trinity River Hupa Each summer a substantial structure of this kind is thrown across the river the southern and the northern divisions of the tribe alternating The weir remains in place until the spring freshets carry it away A fisherman stands on each of several platforms erected below an equal number of openings in the weir and lowers and draws his dip net at random As the construction of a weir is a communal undertaking the catch is divided each evening according to the requirements of the various families 460 Gathering wokas Klamath Wokas the seeds of the water lily Nymphaea polysepala is harvested in the latter part of August and throughout September The nearly ripe pods are plucked and deposited in the canoe but the mature ones having burst open are too sticky to be plucked and are scooped up in a tule ladle and placed in a basket After the pods have fermented the seeds are separated from the mass by stirring in water They are then dried parched hulled dried again and stored in bags Wokas was formerly a staple food and is still much used as a luxury 461 Woman s primitive dress Tolowa This is the gala costume of Coast Athapascan women The ordinary dress was a deerskin kilt with the opening at the front protected by a fringed apron of deerskin or of bark Ordinarily the feet and the upper part of the body were bare 462 Wokas season Klamath 463 Crater Lake Crater lake a body of water indescribably blue occupies an extinct crater in the heart of the Cascade mountains of southern Oregon It is on the boundary of what was formerly the territory of the Klamath Indians who held it to be especially potent in conferring shamanistic power upon men who there fasted and bathed An important Klamath myth seeks to account for the former absence of fish from Crater lake a condition that was altered in 1888 by the introduction of trout 464 Achomawi basket maker The Achomawi or Pit River Indians produce baskets only by the process known as twining which is true weaving never by coiling which is actually a sewing process In general their baskets have bottoms and sides slightly rounded openings broad and depth rather shallow The usual materials are willow rods for the warp or upright elements and pie root strands for the weft or horizontal elements The structure in the background is a summer hut a rudely conical or hemispherical tipi covered with tule mats The workwoman is wearing a rabbit skin robe 465 Fishing platform on Trinity River Hupa As the run of spring salmon occurs at a season when the river is too high for the construction of a weir they are taken in dip nets from platforms erected above favorable eddies 466 Achomawi man 467 Principal female shaman of the Hupa Many Hupa shamans were women and among their neighbors the Yurok and the Karok as well as among the more distant Wiyot on the coast male shamans were rare Hupa shamans acquired the power to cure disease by dreaming and dancing They were credited with the ability to inflict mysterious sickness by sorcery and only they could relieve the victim of such magic 468 Hupa woman in primitive costume This is an excellent example of the gala costume of Hupa women The deerskin skirt is worn about the hips and meets in front where the opening is covered by a similar garment Both are fringed and heavily beaded and the strands of the apron are ornamented with the shells of pine nuts 469 Smelt fisher Trinidad Yurok The surf net used in smelt fishing is a bag suspended on two diverging poles At the bottom of the net proper is a restricted opening into a long net bag which is held in the fisherman s hand Dipping and raising his net he allows the imprisoned smelts to fall down into the bag where they are securely held until he has enough to justify him in going ashore to empty it 470 Chief Klamath The subject of this plate in deerskin suit and feathered war bonnet of the Plains culture is shown against a background of Crater lake and its precipitous rim towering a thousand feet above the water 471 Smoky day at the Sugar Bowl Hupa For the spring salmon fishing season the southern division of the Hupa assembled at Sugar Bowl rapids of Trinity river near the upper end of Hoopa valley Each fishing station was the hereditary possession of some family Men who owned no station begged the use of one from those who were either weary of fishing or had enough salmon for their immediate needs",
