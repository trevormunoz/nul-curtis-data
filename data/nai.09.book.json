concealment and by signs he directed them to embark and follow him They soon reached a village of pigmies and the two strangers were hospitably received Here they remained until the Ducks began to fly northward The Ducks made war on the little people and slew many of them for the pigmies though very strong died when a feather so much as touched them By shooting their wing feathers the Ducks were rapidly exterminating the village when the two men each grasping a war club ran out and killed many of the bird warriors and their scout Gull told the Ducks to retreat from these human beings The two happening to pull the feathers out of a slain pigmy were astonished to see him come to life and they went over the battlefield and thus revived all the dead After this the strangers made a feast of the Ducks but they were not permitted to eat them in the village for the Ducks appeared as people to the dwarfs Grateful for their escape from the Ducks the pigmies called Whale and told the two men to get inside and be taken home They filled the Whale with dentalium shells and made the canoe fast to his tail In a short time the two men caught sight of their home and the Whale stopped to tell them to go ahead in their canoe and warn all women in their periods not to look at him as he came up Then he swam toward the village to unload the shells but a curious woman looked and immediately the Whale disappeared with the valuable shells",
