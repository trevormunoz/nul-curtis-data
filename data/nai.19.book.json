filial devotion and submission until then unequaled among the Indians Kitchechaonissi loved him as much as a father and chief can love a distinguished son the favorite of the village the hero of the

and invite all the elders of the village to the Feast of the Bear Through oversight the young hunter forgot four old men of the great medicine band but he resolved to return to the desert immediately after the feast in order to invite them the first to a second banquet The mirth and rejoicings of the people were great on this occasion for it was the first time since the death of his five sons that

celebrated his great bravery and lofty virtues Alas grief followed closely this paternal triumph the next day the young hero found himself unwell the most famous jugglers were called in to his aid but

children in the land of souls One day while seated at the edge of a torrent plunged in reveries he thought he heard a voice saying Rise Kitchechaonissi rise quickly cross the river climb the steep hills and you shall see your son whom you so mourn He rose at once the sun had just finished his course and disappeared behind the distant bluffs The old man looked about him on all sides but seeing no one he raised his eyes and hands toward heaven exclaiming How now Shall I see my son My fingers closed his eyes my hands dug his grave my lips kissed his pale and livid brow before lowering him beside his unhappy brothers But an irresistible power seemed to drag him on he obeyed it He threw himself into the torrent and gained the opposite shore it was a desert place difficult of access How great was his surprise when he heard the dull sound of a drum coming from a ravine on the farther side of the great hill Like the hunter who has found the trail of the animal he pursues the old man crossed the high mound with a speed astonishing for his age The sound of the drum becomes louder and louder as he proceeds and his uneasiness and curiosity are extreme He stops an instant to take breath and to look about him with caution He soon discovers in a deep ravine a bark lodge whence the noise issues Under cover of the darkness he hastens with a light step toward the mysterious spot He trembles in all his limbs his blood is ice in his veins scarcely can he breathe A thousand phantoms rise before his imagination excited and disturbed by so many troubles The promise that he had heard upon the rock You shall see your son at last reanimates his courage He takes a few steps forward looks in at a chink in the lodge and is seized with astonishment indignation and horror he recognizes the four old men who did not take part in the Feast of the Bear busied in horrid incantations with their medicine bag spread out before them He looks more closely and sees five skulls upon posts He goes around the cabin looks through another crack and discovers by the firelight a fifth Indian standing motionless at the farther end of the lodge Is it his son He examines him attentively He has the same garments the same ornaments with which he was buried It was thus that he had painted his face at his last feast But why this livid hue these closed eyes this corpselike appearance How has he come to this fearful desert and in a society a thousand times more fearful yet For a long time Kitchechaonissi had suspected these four old men of being the cause of his sorrows Thoughts of vengeance hope

have been placed the hand is opened and the sticks let fall The greatest number of any one color showing wins The game most commonly played by both sexes is the hand guessing game The players are divided into two sides An umpire who has two piles of six counters each chooses one woman from each side While men are represented on the sides the women do the guessing To one of these he gives two small bone markers which she conceals in one hand making passes to confuse her opponent who tries to guess in which hand they are concealed If the opponent guesses correctly she in her turn takes the markers but if she loses she must continue to guess until she wins though with each wrong guess the umpire places a counter from her pile on that of her opponent After each has guessed from the other the first player gives one marker each to two of her side while the second player guesses in which hand they are concealed If she loses on both markers she loses two counters if but one guess is wrong one counter if she wins it is her turn to take the markers to any two of her side while her opponent guesses in turn Each side has its own drum and corps of drummers who drum and chant while their side possesses the markers When the umpire has all the counters in one pile that side wins and dances around its drum The second game follows in the same manner POLITICAL ORGANIZATION Chieftainship is usually hereditary the office passing in terms of kinship to eldest son son of eldest son second son or sister s son provided these are worthy of the position Should there be no descendants or should they be unworthy election is held by the council The council sama is composed of chiefs of the seven original clans who hold position by heredity or election in a manner similar to the chieftainship Their duty is to discuss all matters of importance to the tribe The tribe is divided into two groups of clans first Bear and subsidiaries Elk Eagle and Beaver second Owl and subsidiaries Buffalo Snake and Pigeon There are two societies of political importance the Buffalo and the Otter Since each clan chief belongs to one or the other these societies become the power behind the council The main object of the societies is to promote men of worth with qualities of leadership hence only persons of recognized standing in the tribe may be eligible to membership Besides the various dance societies

ORGANIZATION Although there was no organized camp circle and clans and families had no fixed position the camp was circular in shape with the council and sanctuary lodges in the centre Clans were composed of family groups and were strictly exogamous Descent was matrilineal children belonging to the clan of the mother though the father owed allegiance to his own clan Tattooing of girls when they had reached marriageable age signified that they were virgins and of Oto descent MARRIAGE Courtship necessitated the exercise of cunning as the sexes especially at the age of puberty were kept strictly apart When the families of the couple had consented to their marriage consent was necessary and elopement punished a feast was given by the girl s parents and a payment equivalent to her supposed worth was made to her father or uncle This formal feast constituted the marriage rite Monogamy was the rule though polygyny was practised by chiefs and headmen Marriage of one daughter conveyed a prior claim on her maturing sisters for the economic purpose of keeping wealth in the family or in the case of chiefs to keep the blood relationship in the family There was no taboo of the mother in law but marked respect was paid to her by sons in law Divorce was effected by the consent of the respective parents of the couple involved in which case the woman returned to her family and the man lost his original payment Adultery was punished in the case of the man through the council which on finding him guilty ordered a severe whipping A woman so found became an outcast and

men invaded the Great plains and ruthlessly slaughtered them by the hundreds of thousands bison were of prime importance to the hunting tribes of the vast region in which those animals had their range The bison was not only the chief source of food of the Plains Indians but its skin was made into clothing shields packs bags snowshoes and tent and boat covers the horns were fashioned into spoons and drinking vessels the sinew was woven into reatas belts personal ornaments and the covers of sacred bundles and the dried droppings buffalo chips were used as fuel So dependent on the buffalo were these Indians that it became sacred to them and many were the ceremonies performed for the purpose of promoting the increase of the herds 653 A Wichita The Wichita belong to the Caddoan linguistic family and in the earliest historical times lived in the Arkansas valley in the present Kansas Here they were visited by Coronado and his force of Spaniards in 1541 in a region known to them through Indian informants as the Province of Quivira Then as in later times after moving southward the Wichita lived in grass houses 654 Wichita grass house The relatively permanent character of the typical dwelling of the Wichita indicates the sedentary life of this tribe They were farmers in the main but hunted the buffalo and other game in season 655 Grass house ceremony Wichita The rites performed at the building of a grass house are described in Volume XIX pages 64 72 656 Henry Wichita The native names of the Indians are often unpronounceable by untrained white people who therefore apply such incongruous English names as this and the following 657 Walter Ross Wichita 658 Story of the Washita An Old Cheyenne warrior recounts the famous battle of the Washita in 1868 when the tribe was severely defeated by General Custer 659 On the Canadian River The name of the Canadian river was not derived from any association with Canada or the Canadians but from the Spanish ca\u00f1ada on account of the high cut banks of the stream The Canadian originally divided the lands claimed by the Quapaw on the south and those of the Great and Little Osage on the both The Indians in the picture are Cheyenne 660 Cheyenne sun dance lodge For an account of the Sun dance ceremony and the erection of the lodge among the Southern Cheyenne see Volume XIX pages 121 128 661 Hotamitaye Society Cheyenne sun dance The members of this and other bands which were created by the Prophet of Cheyenne legend go to the forest for the poles with which to build the lodge While in the forest they decorate themselves and their horses with willow branches leaving the rearmost horsemen to drag the poles to camp 662 Water rite purification Cheyenne animal dance The legend of the Animal dance is given on pages 133 135 of Volume XIX 663 At the pool animal dance Cheyenne 664 Cheyenne chief The Cheyenne belong to the Algonquian linguistic family and therefore are related to the tribes of the Blackfoot Confederacy and to the Arapaho of the north and much more remotely to many of the tribes that once lives along the Atlantic seaboard and in the Midwest They are now divided into the Northern Cheyenne living in Montana and the Southern Cheyenne who were assigned a reservation in the present Oklahoma in 1867 665 Lone Chief Cheyenne 666 Cheyenne costume This woman s deerskin costume ornamented with porcupine quill embroidery and with beads and fringe is characteristic of that of the Cheyenne but such is now worn only on gala occasions and probably ere very long will be a thing of the past 667 Cheyenne maiden 668 Dog woman Cheyenne The woman s dress is embellished with elk teeth 669 Woista Cheyenne woman Remarkable strength of character is depicted in the features of this woman and indeed in those of all the Cheyenne Their former life was such that only the fittest could survive 670 Reuben Taylor Istofhuts Cheyenne 671 Black Belly Cheyenne The extreme age of this Cheyenne is quite apparent 672 Old Cheyenne 673 Old warrior Arapaho The Arapaho of Algonquian stock like the Cheyenne are divided into Northern and a Southern tribe the former living on the Wind River reservation in Wyoming and the latter on the reservation assigned to them and the Cheyenne in the present Oklahoma in 1867 674 Black Man Arapaho 675 Standing Two Oto The Oto belong to the great Siouan linguistic family and originally formed with other tribes a part of the Winnebago The typical ceremonial head dress of the Oto of the present time is shown here and in the nest three plates 676 Lone Chief Oto 677 Wakonda Oto 678 Pipe stem Oto 679 Old Eagle Oto The head dress of this Oto is characteristic of the older style like that worn also by the related Osage in plate 680 and the adopted head dress of the Comanche in plate 683 The medal worn by Old Eagle in this case bearing the portrait of Lincoln is like other medals given by the Government to noted chiefs from Washington s time 680 John Abbott Osage The Osage corrupted from Whzahzae their own name is a Siouan tribe the wealthiest of all Indians and probably the richest people in the world population considered They are most closely related to the Omaha Quapaw Ponca and Kansa with whom they once formed a single body 681 John Quapaw Hunta Wakunta The Quapaw are another Siouan tribe otherwise known as Akansa from which Arkansas river and state derive their name 682 Esipermi Comanche There were no more vigorous people among the Indians of the Plains than the Comanche a Shoshonean tribe related to the Shoshone and Bannock of Idaho from which region they entered the northern plains and drifted ever southward following the bison in their wanderings They were noted warriors and raiders being the enemies of many tribes and extending their depredations far into Mexico One need look no farther than the accompanying portraits to discern the warrior character of those old braves 683 Lefthand Comanche 684 Uwat Comanche 685 A Comanche mother 686 A Comanche 687 Peyote drummer The Peyote rite as practised by the Indians of Oklahoma is described in Volume XIX No Indian custom has been the subject of greater controversy or has led to the adoption of more laws and regulations with a view of abolishing it largely because its effects have been misunderstood by white people",
