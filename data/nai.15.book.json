509 Basketry of the Mission Indians 510 Cupe\u00f1o woman The Cupe\u00f1o are a small Shoshonean group of mountaineers formerly residing at the head of San Luis Rey river in north central San Diego county Popularly known as Aguas Calientes and as Warner s Ranch Indians they gained considerable prominence at the beginning of the century when the Supreme Court ruled adversely upon their title to the land of their nativity In 1903 they were settled at Pala reservation on lands adjoining those of the Luise\u00f1os and their former habitat is now beautiful Warner s ranch Cupe\u00f1o is a Spanish derivative of Kupa the name of their former village The surviving population of Wolak the other Cupe\u00f1o settlement is now on Los Coyotes reservati 511 Modern Cupe\u00f1o house 512 Serrano woman of Tejon The Serranos Spanish mountaineers a Shoshonean branch comprising numerous local groups occupied San Bernardino valley San Bernardino mountains north of Los Angeles and San Bernardino a portion of Mojave desert north of that range and east of Mojave river and Tehachapi mountains This last group who lived principally on El Paso and Tejon creeks were the Kitanemuk In 1853 most of the resident Indians including not only various Shoshoneans but many Yokuts were taken to Tule river reservation Tejon rancheria remains however a settlement of various Shoshoneans but predominantly Kitanemuk 513 Tejon Serrano 514 Modern house at Tejon 515 Chemehuevi house The Chemehuevi are closely allied linguistically to the Paiute of southern Nevada from which region they undoubtedly came in the not distant past In the historical period they have held the eastern half of San Bernardino county and the eastern end of Riverside On Colorado river they held the lowlands on both sides between Needles and Bill Williams fork and a group is still resident there in Chemehuevi valley Those who settled in the valley which apparently was subsequent to 1776 because in that year the diary of his journey
