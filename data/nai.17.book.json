were so beset by roving enemies that not a few of them for purposes of defense became cliff dwellers See Volume XVII illustrations facing pages 30 32 With a watchman posted in a niche of the cliff or on a commanding elevation there was little chance of an enemy surprising laborers in the cornfields 581 Povi Tamu Flower Morning San Ildefonso The flower concept is a favorite one in Tewa names both masculine and feminine The regular features of the comely Morning Flower are not exceptional for most Tewa girls and indeed most Pueblo girls are not without attractiveness 582 Okuwa tse Cloud Yellow San Ildefonso 583 On the Rio Grande San Ildefonso The plate illustrates the native garb of Tewa women a sleeveless one piece woollen dress a woven belt and white deerskin boots 584 Kiva stairs San Ildefonso Pueblo ceremonial chambers are known as kivas the Hopi name or estufas the name applied to them by the Spaniards under the misapprehension that they were sudatories They are circular or rectangular wholly or partly subterranean or simply cells in the communal structure that forms a pueblo The character of the underlying soil or rock was probably the factor that determined the degree to which a kiva was made subterranean The one here illustrated is mostly underground and has a walled stair leading to the roof which is surrounded by a parapet Similar structures have been found in excavating ruined pueblos See Volume XVII illustration facing page 68 585 Fruit gatherer San Ildefonso Among the valued gifts of the early Spanish priests was the peach Every pueblo has its orchards of scrubby twisted trees which without cultivation yield fruit of small size but agreeable flavor 586 Offering San Ildefonso A pinch of cornmeal tossed into the air as an offering to the numerous deities of the Tewa but especially to the sun is a formality that begins the day and precedes innumerable acts of the most commonplace nature 587 San Ildefonso pottery San Ildefonso possesses some very capable potters The polished black vessel at the left represents a recent revival under the stimulus of commercial encouragement of an ancient phase of the potter s art for it answers the description of black ware observed by Coronado s chronicles 588 Tablita dancers and singers San Ildefonso The ceremony called Koheye hyare tablita dance occurring in June and again in September is characterized by public dancing and singing for the purpose of bringing rain clouds The name refers to wooden tablets worn by female dancers See Volume XVII illustrations facing pages 56 60 62 64 66 68 In the plate the performers are dancing in to the plaza men and women alternating in pairs At the right is the group of singers their aged leader slightly in advance and the drummer at one side 589 In San Ildefonso 590 Girl and jar San Ildefonso Pueblo women are adept at balancing burdens on the head Usually a vessel rests on a fibre ring which serves to steady it and to protect the scalp The design on the jar here illustrated recalls the importance of the serpent cult in Tewa life See Volume XVII pages 19 24 77 80 591 In the gray morning San Ildefonso A housewife fills her jar with a gourd ladle at a shallow pool In the background is the Rio Grande at the season of high water and in the distance is a rugged mesa 592 Offering to the sun San Ildefonso 593 From the threshing floor San Juan Grain is threshed by the hoofs of horses or goats in the fashion of Biblical times See Volume XVI illustration facing page 42 594 Washing wheat San Juan Threshed by the aid of animals and winnowed by tossing in the breeze wheat is placed in loose mesh baskets and submerged in the water of an acequia Particles of earth are thus dissolved and floating bits of straw and chaff are scooped off After thoroughly drying in the sun the grain is stored in bags 595 Street scene at San Juan 596 Ambrosio Martinez San Juan The original of this portrait could readily pass for an Indian of the southern plains The influence of Plains blood is noticeable at all Tewa pueblos and especially at San Juan the most northerly of them The typical Pueblo man is small featured and of short to medium stature 597 San Juan pottery 598 Gossiping San Juan 599 Offering at the waterfall Nambe Feather offerings are deposited in numerous shrines buried in the earth near the pueblo and placed in springs streams and lakes for the purpose of winning the favor of the cloud gods 600 Tesuque buffalo dancers The Buffalo dance is performed though the original object of exerting prenatural influence on the abundance and accessibility of the buffalo no longer prevails The two male dancers are accompanied by the Buffalo Girl who is fully clothed in native costume and has a pair of small horns on the head These three give a very striking and dramatic performance under the watchful eye of the head of the hunters society 601 Oyi Duck White summer cacique of Santa Clara Each Tewa pueblo is dominated by two native priests the so called caciques one of whom is in charge of religious activities from the end of February to the middle of October the other during the remainder of the year 602 Potter Santa Clara The potter is polishing a vessel The smooth pebbles used for this purpose are found in small heaps among or near deposits of fossil bones They are the stomach pebbles of dinosaurs Tewa women prize them highly refuse to part with them and foresee ill luck if one is lost 603 Pottery burners at Santa Clara Only with considerable practice can pottery be fired successfully The vessels and the surrounding fuel of dry dung must be so placed and the fire must be so controlled that while perfect combustion takes place high temperature shall not develop too quickly Cracked and blackened ware is the penalty of inexperience and carelessness 604 Inscription rock Inscription Rock or El Morro The Castle as the Spaniards called it is a striking landmark on the ancient trail between Acoma and Zuni Beginning with Juan de Onate who passed here in April 1605 on his return to the Rio Grande from the south sea Spanish explorers and the administrators recorded their names and dates on smooth surfaces of the cliff which reveal also numerous Indian petroglyphs See Volume XVII illustration facing page 88 Two ancient ruined pueblos are found on the top of the rock 605 Zuni street scene 606 Grinding medicine Zuni Medicine and mineral pigments are ground in small stone mortars by means of a water worn pebble 607 Zuni governor This portrait may well be taken as representative of the typical Pueblo physiognomy 608 Load of fuel Zuni The Zuni tribe now numbering twenty two hundred has been concentrated in the present pueblo and its farming villages for nearly two and a half centuries and in the same valley for hundreds of years before Only a people as frugal as all the Pueblos in the use of fuel could still have an available supply in a region so poorly provided by nature 609 Terraced houses of Zuni In the early eighties one of the house groups of Zuni rose to a height of six well defined stories In 1903 when the photograph here reproduced was made there were five stories In 1910 a single apartment was four stories from the ground but in 1919 this room was demolished Note the bottomless pots forming chimneys the wooden drain piercing the coping the hemispherical oven of Spanish provenience on a roof 610 Zuni girls at the river 611 Lutakawi Zuni Governor 612 Waihusiwa a Zuni kyaqimassi Kyaqimassi house chief is the title of the Shiwanni of the north the most important of all Zuni priests Waihusiwa in his youth spent the summer and fall of 1886 in the East with Franklin Hamilton Cushing and was the narrator of much of the lore published in Cushing s Zuni Folk Tales A highly spiritual man he is one of the most steadfast of the Zuni priests upholding the traditions of the native religion 613 Zuni girl 614 Zuni woman Bowls of food are often thus carried on the head with a woven yucca ring during an intermission in or following a ceremony when the participants feast 615 Corner of Zuni The chamber at the left with ladder poles projecting from the hatchway is the kiva of the north Many dances are performed in the small plaza here shown The dark material piled against one of the houses is sheep dung for firing pottery",
